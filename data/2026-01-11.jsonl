Existing studies have shown that popular orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) and affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) offer significant advantages over orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) in uncoded doubly selective channels. However, it remains uncertain whether these benefits extend to coded systems. Meanwhile, the information-theoretic limit analysis of coded MIMO multicarrier systems and the corresponding low-complexity receiver design remain unclear. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-slot cross-domain memory approximate message passing (MS-CD-MAMP) receiver as well as develops its information-theoretic (i.e., achievable rate) limit and optimal coding principle for MIMO-multicarrier modulation (e.g., OFDM, OTFS, and AFDM) systems. The proposed MS-CD-MAMP receiver can exploit not only the time domain channel sparsity for low complexity but also the corresponding symbol domain constellation constraints for performance enhancement. Meanwhile, limited by the high-dimensional complex state evolution (SE), a simplified single-input single-output variational SE is proposed to derive the achievable rate of MS-CD-MAMP and the optimal coding principle with the goal of maximizing the achievable rate. Numerical results show that coded MIMO-OFDM/OTFS/AFDM with MS-CD-MAMP achieve the same maximum achievable rate in doubly selective channels, whose finite-length performance with practical optimized low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes is only 0.5 $\\sim$ 1.8 dB away from the associated theoretical limit, and has 0.8 $\\sim$ 4.4 dB gain over the well-designed point-to-point LDPC codes."}

However, traditional coverage-hole detection approaches, such as minimizing drive tests, are costly, time-consuming, and reliant on outdated radio-environment data, making them unsuitable for real-time applications. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a UAV-assisted framework for real-time detection and recovery of coverage holes in IoT networks. In the proposed scheme, a patrol UAV is first dispatched to identify coverage holes in regions where the operational status of terrestrial base stations (BSs) is uncertain. Once a coverage hole is detected, one or more UAVs acting as aerial BSs are deployed by a satellite or nearby operational BSs to restore connectivity. The UAV swarm is organized based on Delaunay triangulation, enabling scalable deployment and tractable analytical characterization using stochastic geometry. Moreover, a collision-avoidance mechanism grounded in multi-agent system theory ensures safe and coordinated motion among multiple UAVs. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves high efficiency in both coverage-hole detection and on-demand connectivity restoration while significantly reducing operational cost and time."}

We examine how element requirements scale with key system parameters, transmit power, data rate demands, and outage constraints under both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) ssRIS-to-user equipment (UE) channels. Analytical and numerical results reveal distinct feasibility characteristics. The TS scheme demonstrates better channel hardening gain, maintaining stable element requirements across varying outage margins, making it advantageous for indoor deployments with favorable harvesting conditions and moderate data rates. However, TS exhibits an element requirement that exponentially scales to harvesting difficulty and data rate. Conversely, the ES scheme shows only linear growth with harvesting difficulty, providing better feasibility under challenging outdoor scenarios. These findings establish that TS excels in benign environments, prioritizing reliability, while ES is preferable for demanding conditions requiring operational robustness."}

To address this gap, we explore incentive mechanism design for FL with network effects and application-specific requirements of model performance. We develop a theoretical model to quantify the impact of network effects on heterogeneous client participation, revealing the non-monotonic nature of such effects. Based on these insights, we propose a Model Trading and Sharing (MoTS) framework, which enables clients to obtain FL models through either participation or purchase. To further address clients' strategic behaviors, we design a Social Welfare maximization with Application-aware and Network effects (SWAN) mechanism, exploiting model customer payments for incentivization. Experimental results on a hardware prototype demonstrate that our SWAN mechanism outperforms existing FL mechanisms, improving social welfare by up to $352.42\\%$ and reducing extra incentive costs by $93.07\\%$."}

Recently, the statistics and machine learning communities have developed prediction-oriented inference approaches that provide better calibrated uncertainties and adapt to the level of misspecification present. However, these approaches have yet to be demonstrated in the context of complex scientific applications where phenomena of interest are governed by physics-based models. Such settings often involve single realizations of high-dimensional spatio-temporal data and nonlinear, computationally expensive parameter-to-observable maps. This work investigates variational prediction-oriented inference in problems exhibiting these relevant features; namely, we consider a polynomial model and a contaminant transport problem governed by advection-diffusion equations. The prediction-oriented loss is formulated as the log-predictive probability of the calibration data. We study the effects of increasing misspecification and noise, and we assess approximations of the predictive density using Monte Carlo sampling and component-wise kernel density estimation. A novel aspect of this work is applying prediction-oriented inference to the calibration of model-form uncertainty (MFU) representations, which are embedded physics-based modifications to the governing equations that aim to reduce (but rarely eliminate) model misspecification. The computational results demonstrate that prediction-oriented frameworks can provide better uncertainty characterizations in comparison to standard inference while also being amenable to the calibration of MFU representations."}

In this paper, we introduce a fully convolutional, conditionally parameterized U-Net surrogate designed to extrapolate far beyond its training data in both space and time. The architecture integrates convolutional self-attention, physically informed padding, and a flood-fill corrector method to maintain accuracy under extreme extrapolation, while conditioning on simulation parameters allows for flexible time-step skipping and adaptation to varying alloy compositions. To remove the need for costly solver-based initialization, we couple the surrogate with a conditional diffusion model that generates synthetic, physically consistent initial conditions. We train our surrogate on simulations generated over small domain sizes and short time spans, but, by taking advantage of the convolutional nature of U-Nets, we are able to run and extrapolate surrogate simulations for longer time horizons than what would be achievable with classic numerical solvers. Across multiple alloy compositions, the framework is able to reproduce the LMD physics accurately. It predicts key quantities of interest and spatial statistics with relative errors typically below 5% in the training regime and under 15% during large-scale, long time-horizon extrapolations. Our framework can also deliver speed-ups of up to 36,000 times, bringing the time to run weeks-long simulations down to a few seconds.

Building on this, we propose a two-stage alignment framework. First, we inject domain knowledge to an auxiliary diffusion model via Supervised Fine-Tuning. Second, we introduce Complex Preference Optimization (CPO) that extends DPO to align the target diffusion to our non-binary, hierarchical criteria.

However, its operational mechanism in the real world remains non-trivial. Currently, an in-laboratory paradigm, called evidence accumulation modelling (EAM), points out that human decision-making involves transforming external evidence into internal mental beliefs. However, the gap in evidence affordance between real-world contexts and laboratory settings hinders the effective application of EAM. Here we generalize EAM to the real world and conduct analysis in real-world driving scenarios. A cognitive scheme is proposed to formalize real-world evidence affordance and capture active sensing through eye movements. Empirically, our scheme can plausibly portray the accumulation of drivers' mental beliefs, explaining how active sensing transforms evidence into mental beliefs from the perspective of information utility. Also, our results demonstrate a negative correlation between evidence affordance and attention recruited by individuals, revealing how human drivers adapt their evidence-collection patterns across various contexts. Moreover, we reveal the positive influence of evidence affordance and attention distribution on decision-making propensity. In a nutshell, our computational scheme generalizes EAM to real-world contexts and provides a comprehensive account of how active sensing underlies real-world decision-making, unveiling multifactorial, integrated characteristics in real-world decision-making."}

The agent wants to reveal the information to a user, hence, the agent utilizes a privacy mechanism to produce disclosed data $U$ that can be revealed. We assume that the agent has no direct access to $X$, i.e., the private data is hidden. We study privacy mechanism design that maximizes the disclosed information about $Y$, measured by the mutual information between $Y$ and $U$, while satisfying a point-wise constraint with different privacy leakage budgets. We introduce a new measure, called the \\emph{multi-level point-wise leakage}, which allows us to impose different leakage levels for different realizations of $U$. In contrast to previous studies on point-wise measures, which use the same leakage level for each realization, we consider a more general scenario in which each data point can leak information up to a different threshold. As a result, this concept also covers cases in which some data points should not leak any information about the private data, i.e., they must satisfy perfect privacy. In other words, a combination of perfect privacy and non-zero leakage can be considered. When the leakage is sufficiently small, concepts from information geometry allow us to locally approximate the mutual information. We show that when the leakage matrix $P_{X|Y}$ is invertible, utilizing this approximation leads to a quadratic optimization problem that has closed-form solution under some constraints. In particular, we show that it is sufficient to consider only binary $U$ to attain the optimal utility. This leads to simple privacy designs with low complexity which are based on finding the maximum singular value and singular vector of a matrix."}

There has been some exploration of indirect grid adaptivity by replacing uniform grids with tetrahedral meshes or locally subdivided grids, as inversion-free deformation of grids is difficult. This work develops an inversion-free grid deformation method that optimizes differential weight to adaptively compress space. The method is the first to optimize grid vertices as differential elements using vertex-colorings, decomposing a dense input linear system into many independent sets of vertices which can be optimized concurrently. This method is then also extended to optimize UV meshes with convex boundaries. Experimentally, this differential representation leads to a smoother optimization manifold than updating extrinsic vertex coordinates. By optimizing each sets of vertices in a coloring separately, local injectivity checks are straightforward since the valid region for each vertex is fixed. This enables the use of optimizers such as Adam, as each vertex can be optimized independently of other vertices. We demonstrate the generality and efficacy of this approach through applications in isosurface extraction for inverse rendering, image compaction, and mesh parameterization."}

Using controlled multi-agent simulations across Ultimatum, Buy-Sell, and Resource Exchange games, we systematically isolate language effects across English and four Indic framings (Hindi, Punjabi, Gujarati, Marwadi) by holding game rules, model parameters, and incentives constant across all conditions. We find that language choice can shift outcomes more strongly than changing models, reversing proposer advantages and reallocating surplus. Crucially, effects are task-contingent: Indic languages reduce stability in distributive games yet induce richer exploration in integrative settings. Our results demonstrate that evaluating LLM negotiation solely in English yields incomplete and potentially misleading conclusions. These findings caution against English-only evaluation of LLMs and suggest that culturally-aware evaluation is essential for fair deployment."}

To overcome this obstacle under a low-data scenario, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning (SSL) method dubbed SemiMol, which employs predictions on numerous unannotated data as pseudo-signals for subsequent training. Specifically, we introduce an additional instructor model to evaluate the accuracy and trustworthiness of proxy labels because existing pseudo-labeling approaches require probabilistic outputs to reveal the model's confidence and fail to be applied in regression tasks.

Existing methods predominantly rely on least and most significant bit (LSB & MSB) manipulation, Pixel Value Differencing (PVD), spatial perturbations in RGB channels, transform domain based methods, Quantization methods, Edge and Region based methods and more recently through deep learning methods and generative AI techniques for hiding textual information in spatial domain of images. Most of them are dependent on pixel intensity flipping over multiple pixels, such as LSB and combination of LSB based methodologies, and on transform coefficients, often resulting in the form of noise. Encoding and Decoding are deterministic in most of the existing approaches and are computationally heavy in case of higher models such as deep learning and gen AI approaches. The proposed method works on quinary pixel intensity combinations in RGB space, where five controlled different pixel intensity variations in each of the R, G, and B channels formulate up to one hundred and twenty five distinct pixel intensity combinations. These combinations are mapped to textual symbols, enabling the representation of uppercase and lowercase alphabetic characters, numeric digits, whitespace, and commonly used special characters. Different metrics such as MSE, MAE, SNR, PSNR, SSIM, Histogram Comparison and Heatmap analysis, were evaluated for both original and encoded images resulting in no significant distortion in the images.

We formalize this in a Markov decision process with a stochastic human-initiated shutdown event. Building on results on convergent instrumental incentives, we show that for almost all reward functions a misaligned agent has an incentive to avoid shutdown. We then derive closed-form thresholds for when confronting humans yields higher expected utility than compliant behavior, as a function of the discount factor $γ$, shutdown probability $p$, and confrontation cost $C$. For example, a far-sighted agent ($γ=0.99$) facing $p=0.01$ can have a strong takeover incentive unless $C$ is sufficiently large. We contrast this with aligned objectives that impose large negative utility for harming humans, which makes confrontation suboptimal. In a strategic 2-player model (human policymaker vs AGI), we prove that if the AGI's confrontation incentive satisfies $Δ\\ge 0$, no stable cooperative equilibrium exists: anticipating this, a rational human will shut down or preempt the system, leading to conflict. If $Δ< 0$, peaceful coexistence can be an equilibrium. We discuss implications for reward design and oversight, extend the reasoning to multi-agent settings as conjectures, and note computational barriers to verifying $Δ< 0$, citing complexity results for planning and decentralized decision problems.

In contrast, we focus on explicit, prompt-free editing, where the user directly specifies the modification by cropping and pasting an object or sub-object into a chosen location within an image. This operation affords precise spatial and visual control, yet it introduces a fundamental challenge: preserving the identity of the pasted object while harmonizing it with its new context. We observe that attention maps in diffusion-based editing models inherently govern whether image regions are preserved or adapted for coherence. Building on this insight, we introduce LooseRoPE, a saliency-guided modulation of rotational positional encoding (RoPE) that loosens the positional constraints to continuously control the attention field of view. By relaxing RoPE in this manner, our method smoothly steers the model's focus between faithful preservation of the input image and coherent harmonization of the inserted object, enabling a balanced trade-off between identity retention and contextual blending. Our approach provides a flexible and intuitive framework for image editing, achieving seamless compositional results without textual descriptions or complex user input."}

In this paper, we introduce a fully convolutional, conditionally parameterized U-Net surrogate designed to extrapolate far beyond its training data in both space and time. The architecture integrates convolutional self-attention, physically informed padding, and a flood-fill corrector method to maintain accuracy under extreme extrapolation, while conditioning on simulation parameters allows for flexible time-step skipping and adaptation to varying alloy compositions. To remove the need for costly solver-based initialization, we couple the surrogate with a conditional diffusion model that generates synthetic, physically consistent initial conditions. We train our surrogate on simulations generated over small domain sizes and short time spans, but, by taking advantage of the convolutional nature of U-Nets, we are able to run and extrapolate surrogate simulations for longer time horizons than what would be achievable with classic numerical solvers. Across multiple alloy compositions, the framework is able to reproduce the LMD physics accurately. It predicts key quantities of interest and spatial statistics with relative errors typically below 5% in the training regime and under 15% during large-scale, long time-horizon extrapolations. Our framework can also deliver speed-ups of up to 36,000 times, bringing the time to run weeks-long simulations down to a few seconds. This work is a first stepping stone towards high-fidelity extrapolation in both space and time of phase-field simulation for LMD."}

This separate, sequential inference process limits cross-modal coupling and prohibits automatic multimodal generation. This work explores post-training to achieve fully unified text-image generation, where models autonomously transition from textual reasoning to visual synthesis within a single inference process. We examine the impact of joint text-image generation on T2I performance and the relative importance of each modality during post-training. We additionally explore different post-training data strategies, showing that a targeted dataset addressing specific limitations achieves superior results compared to broad image-caption corpora or benchmark-aligned data. Using offline, reward-weighted post-training with fully self-generated synthetic data, our approach enables improvements in multimodal image generation across four diverse T2I benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of reward-weighting both modalities and strategically designed post-training data."}

However, most existing approaches rely on predefined measurements or fixed reward signals, which limits their applicability in open-ended and dynamic environments where new actions may require previously unknown forms of feedback. To address these limitations, this paper proposes an Actively Feedback Getting model, in which an AI agent proactively interacts with the environment to discover, screen, and verify feedback without relying on predefined measurements. Rather than assuming explicit feedback definitions, the proposed method exploits action-induced environmental differences to identify target feedback that is not specified in advance, based on the observation that actions inevitably produce measurable changes in the environment. In addition, a self-triggering mechanism, driven by internal objectives such as improved accuracy, precision, and efficiency, is introduced to autonomously plan and adjust actions, thereby enabling faster and more focused feedback acquisition without external commands. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed active approach significantly improves the efficiency and robustness of factor identification."}

Unfortunately, the hardware cost and control complexity of traditional RA systems is proportional to the number of RAs. To address the issue, we consider a cross-linked (CL) RA structure, which enables the coordinated rotation of multiple antennas, thereby offering a cost-effective solution. To evaluate the performance of the CL-RA array, we investigate a CL-RA-aided uplink system. Specifically, we first establish system models for both antenna element-level and antenna panel-level rotation. Then, we formulate a sum rate maximization problem by jointly optimizing the receive beamforming at the base station and the rotation angles. For the antenna element-level rotation, we derive the optimal solution of the CL-RA array under the single-user case. Subsequently, for two rotation schemes, we propose an alternating optimization algorithm to solve the formulated problem in the multi-user case, where the receive beamforming and the antenna rotation angles are obtained by applying the minimum mean square error method and feasible direction method, respectively. In addition, considering the hardware limitations, we apply the genetic algorithm to address the discrete rotation angles selection problem. Simulation results show that by carefully designing the row-column partition scheme, the performance of the CL-RA architecture is quite close to that of the flexible antenna orientation scheme. Moreover, the CL antenna element-level scheme surpasses the CL antenna panel-level scheme by 25% and delivers a 128% performance improvement over conventional fixed-direction antennas."}

To bridge this gap, we present \\textsc{Trisk} (TRusted Industrial Data-Service-Knowledge governance), a novel conceptual and taxonomic framework for trustworthy industrial intelligence.

We systematically analyze how trust propagates across digital layers, identify critical gaps in semantic interoperability, runtime policy enforcement, and operational/information technologies alignment, and evaluate the maturity of current industrial implementations. Finally, we articulate a forward-looking research agenda for Industry 5.0, advocating for an integrated governance fabric that embeds verifiable trust semantics into every layer of the industrial intelligence stack.

This sparse nature of wave propagation is revealed in the beamspace domain, which is traditionally obtained by taking the spatial discrete Fourier transform (DFT) across a uniform linear antenna array at the BS, where each DFT output is associated with a distinct beam. In recent years, beamspace processing has emerged as a promising technique to reduce baseband complexity and power consumption in all-digital massive multiuser (MU) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems operating at mmWave frequencies. However, it remains unclear whether the DFT is the optimal sparsifying transform for finite-dimensional antenna arrays. In this paper, we extend the framework of Zhai et al. for complete dictionary learning via $\\ell^4$-norm maximization to the complex case in order to learn new sparsifying transforms. We provide a theoretical foundation for $\\ell^4$-norm maximization and propose two suitable learning algorithms. We then utilize these algorithms (i) to assess the optimality of the DFT for sparsifying channel vectors theoretically and via simulations and (ii) to learn improved sparsifying transforms for real-world and synthetically generated channel vectors."}

Despite significant research efforts, existing state-of-the-art approaches for CABP are exclusively heuristic or metaheuristic in nature, and exact methods have been limited to restricted graph classes. In this paper, we present the first exact approach for the CABP on general graphs, based on SAT solving, called SAT-CAB. The proposed method is able to systematically explore the solution space and guarantee global optimality, overcoming the limitations of previously reported heuristic algorithms. This approach relies on a novel and efficient SAT encoding of CABP, in which the problem is transformed into a sequence of At-Most-One constraints. In particular, we introduce a compact representation of the At-Most-One constraints inherent to CABP, which significantly reduces the size of the resulting formulas and enables modern SAT solvers to effectively explore the solution space and to certify global optimality. Extensive computational experiments on standard benchmark instances show that the proposed method efficiently solves CABP instances of practical relevance, while identifying several previously unknown optimal solutions. Moreover, global optimal cyclic antibandwidth values are proven for a number of benchmark instances for the first time. Comparative results indicate that SAT-CAB consistently matches or surpasses the best-known solutions obtained by state-of-the-art heuristic algorithms such as MS-GVNS, HABC-CAB, and MACAB, as well as strong commercial Constraint Programming and Mixed Integer Programming solvers like CPLEX and Gurobi, particularly on general graphs, while also providing optimality guarantees.

However, recent studies show that LLMs perform poorly on telecom standards, particularly 3GPP specifications. We argue that a key reason is that these standards densely include tables to present essential information, yet the LLM knowledge and interpretation ability of such tables remains largely unexamined. To address this gap, we introduce TeleTables, a benchmark designed to evaluate both the implicit knowledge LLMs have about tables in technical specifications and their explicit ability to interpret them. TeleTables is built through a novel multi-stage data generation pipeline that extracts tables from 3GPP standards and uses multimodal and reasoning-oriented LLMs to generate and validate questions. The resulting dataset, which is publicly available, comprises 500 human-verified question-answer pairs, each associated with the corresponding table in multiple formats. Our evaluation shows that, smaller models (under 10B parameters) struggle both to recall 3GPP knowledge and to interpret tables, indicating the limited exposure to telecom standards in their pretraining and the insufficient inductive biases for navigating complex technical material. Larger models, on the other hand, show stronger reasoning on table interpretation. Overall, TeleTables highlights the need for domain-specialized fine-tuning to reliably interpret and reason over telecom standards."}

A recent development in this area is the introduction of SLEEC (Social, Legal, Ethical, Empathetic, and Cultural) rules, which provide a comprehensive framework for representing ethical and other normative considerations. This paper proposes a logical representation of SLEEC rules and presents a methodology to embed these ethical requirements using test-score semantics and fuzzy logic. The use of fuzzy logic is motivated by the view of ethics as a domain of possibilities, which allows the resolution of ethical dilemmas that AI systems may encounter. The proposed approach is illustrated through a case study."}

We begin by introducing the background of beamforming in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems and the signaling procedures for codebook-based beamforming in practical 5G systems. Then, we establish the fundamentals of regular codebooks and port-selection codebooks in 3GPP standards. Next, we provide rigorous technical analysis of 3GPP codebook evolution spanning Releases 15-18, with particular focus on: 1) We elucidate the core principles underlying codebook design, 2) provide clear physical interpretations for each symbolic variable in the codebook formulas, summarized in tabular form, and 3) offer intuitive visual illustrations to explain how codebook parameters convey information. These essential pedagogical elements are almost entirely absent in the often-obscure standardization documents. Through mathematical modeling, performance benchmarking, feedback comparisons, and scenario-dependent applicability analysis, we provide researchers and engineers with a unified understanding of beamforming codebooks in real-world systems. Furthermore, we identify future directions and other beamforming scenarios for ongoing research and development efforts. This work serves as both an informative tutorial and a guidance for future research, facilitating more effective collaboration between academia and industry in advancing wireless communication technologies."}

In front-end development, visual artifacts such as sketches, mockups and annotated creenshots are essential for conveying design intent, yet their role in multi-turn code generation remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we focus on the front-end development task and curate FronTalk, a collection of 100 multi-turn dialogues derived from real-world websites across diverse domains such as news, finance, and art. Each turn features both a textual instruction and an equivalent visual instruction, each representing the same user intent. To comprehensively evaluate model performance, we propose a novel agent-based evaluation framework leveraging a web agent to simulate users and explore the website, and thus measuring both functional correctness and user experience. Evaluation of 20 models reveals two key challenges that are under-explored systematically in the literature: (1) a significant forgetting issue where models overwrite previously implemented features, resulting in task failures, and (2) a persistent challenge in interpreting visual feedback, especially for open-source vision-language models (VLMs). We propose a strong baseline to tackle the forgetting issue with AceCoder, a method that critiques the implementation of every past instruction using an autonomous web agent. This approach significantly reduces forgetting to nearly zero and improves the performance by up to 9.3% (56.0% to 65.3%). Overall, we aim to provide a solid foundation for future research in front-end development and the general interaction dynamics of multi-turn, multi-modal code generation.

Such models rely on the KV-cache mechanism to reduce attention computation from O(T^2) to O(T); however, KV-cache size grows linearly with the number of generated tokens, and it rapidly becomes the dominant bottleneck limiting inference efficiency and generative length. Unified autoregressive video generation inherits this limitation. Our analysis reveals that KV-cache tokens exhibit distinct spatiotemporal properties: (i) text and conditioning-image tokens act as persistent semantic anchors that consistently receive high attention, and (ii) attention to previous frames naturally decays with temporal distance. Leveraging these observations, we introduce PackCache, a training-free KV-cache management method that dynamically compacts the KV cache through three coordinated mechanisms: condition anchoring that preserves semantic references, cross-frame decay modeling that allocates cache budget according to temporal distance, and spatially preserving position embedding that maintains coherent 3D structure under cache removal. In terms of efficiency, PackCache accelerates end-to-end generation by 1.7-2.2x on 48-frame long sequences, showcasing its strong potential for enabling longer-sequence video generation. Notably, the final four frames - the portion most impacted by the progressively expanding KV-cache and thus the most expensive segment of the clip - PackCache delivers a 2.6x and 3.7x acceleration on A40 and H200, respectively, for 48-frame videos."}

Using a synthetic evaluation framework with 120 trials across four models (LLaMA-3 8B, LLaMA-2 13B, Mixtral 8x7B, DeepSeek-V2 16B), we report three key findings: (1) Multi-agent amplification depends on base capability: statistically significant gains occur only for models with sufficient reasoning ability (p < 0.001 for LLaMA-3 8B, p = 0.014 for Mixtral), with improvements of up to 46.7 percentage points, while weaker models show no benefit, suggesting amplification rather than compensation; (2) Active parameters predict reasoning performance: Mixtral's performance aligns with its ~12B active parameters rather than 47B total, consistent with the hypothesis that inference-time compute drives reasoning capability in MoE architectures; (3) Architecture quality matters: LLaMA-3 8B outperforms LLaMA-2 13B despite fewer parameters, consistent with known training improvements. Our results provide controlled quantitative evidence for intuitions about multi-agent coordination and MoE scaling, while highlighting the dependence of multi-agent benefits on base model capability.

Unlike conventional asymptotic analyses, we explicitly account for the limitations under FBL constraints imposed by short packets and low-latency transmission. By examining the unbiased channel state sensing estimator, we establish a geometric decomposition of the sensing error, indicating that it is jointly determined by the signal-to-noise ratio and the correlation structure of the information codebook. This insight reveals how cross-correlation among active users in the codebook geometry fundamentally constrains dual-functional ISAC performance. Consequently, we derive achievability and converse bounds that characterize the tradeoff between communication code rate and sensing accuracy in the FBL regime, with the converse further bounded by Shannon capacity. Moreover, by treating channel state sensing as a high-level sensing objective, a universal Cramér--Rao bound is derived to link channel estimation accuracy to practical sensing parameters. Examples of parameter sensing are also provided based on 3GPP standard. Numerical results validate the theoretical analysis and demonstrate the impact of blocklength, antenna dimensions, and sensing requirements."}

At each timestep, the remasking strategy of a DLM selects low-priority tokens to defer their decoding, thereby improving both efficiency and output quality. However, mainstream remasking strategies rely on a single global confidence threshold, overlooking the temporal and spatial dynamics of individual tokens. Motivated by the redundant iterations and constrained parallelism introduced by fixed-threshold remasking, we propose a novel remasking approach that dynamically detects Temporal Variance and Spatial Deviance of each token, which reflect its convergence status and inter-token correlations. Using these signals, our method adaptively adjusts the confidence threshold for every token at every step. Empirical results show that our approach significantly improves the operational efficiency of DLMs across mainstream datasets, achieving speedups of up to 8.9 times while faithfully preserving generation quality."}

Paired hypothesis tests between baseline and stressor phases reveal that 41 of 56 coefficients show consistent, phase-specific stress responses comparable to physiological markers. Building on this, we propose a Transformer-based temporal modeling framework and assess unimodal, early-fusion, and cross-modal attention strategies. Cross-Modal Attention fusion of EMOCA and physiological signals achieves best performance (AUROC 92\\%, Accuracy 86.7\\%), with EMOCA-gaze fusion also competitive (AUROC 91.8\\%).

We propose RLMIL-DAT, a multilingual extension of the reinforced multiple instance learning framework that combines reinforcement learning based instance selection with domain adversarial training to encourage language invariant utterance representations. We evaluate the approach on a five language Twitter corpus in a few shot setting and on a VoxCeleb2 derived corpus covering forty languages in a zero shot setting for gender and age prediction. Across a wide range of model configurations and multiple random seeds, RLMIL-DAT consistently improves Macro F1 compared to standard multiple instance learning and the original reinforced multiple instance learning framework. The largest gains are observed for gender prediction, while age prediction remains more challenging and shows smaller but positive improvements. Ablation experiments indicate that domain adversarial training is the primary contributor to the performance gains, enabling effective transfer from high resource English to lower resource languages by discouraging language specific cues in the shared encoder. In the zero shot setting on the smaller VoxCeleb2 subset, improvements are generally positive but less consistent, reflecting limited statistical power and the difficulty of generalizing to many unseen languages. Overall, the results demonstrate that combining instance selection with adversarial domain adaptation is an effective and robust strategy for cross lingual speaker attribute prediction."}

Most existing studies focus on the scenario in which the two graphs share the same vertex set. However, in many real-world applications, such as computer vision, social network analysis, and bioinformatics, the task often involves locating a small graph pattern within a larger graph. Existing graph alignment algorithms and analysis cannot directly address these scenarios because they are not designed to identify the specific subset of vertices where the small graph pattern resides within the larger graph. Motivated by this limitation, we introduce the subgraph alignment problem, which seeks to recover both the vertex set and/or the vertex correspondence of a small graph pattern embedded in a larger graph. In the special case where the small graph pattern is an induced subgraph of the larger graph and both the vertex set and correspondence are to be recovered, the problem reduces to the subgraph isomorphism problem, which is NP-complete in the worst case. In this paper, we formally formulate the subgraph alignment problem by proposing the Erdos-Renyi subgraph pair model together with some appropriate recovery criterion. We then establish almost-tight information-theoretic results for the subgraph alignment problem and present some novel approaches for the analysis."}

To overcome this, we fine-tuned the model on a curated dataset specific to admissions processes, enhancing its ability to interpret RAG-provided data accurately and generate domain-relevant outputs. This hybrid approach leverages RAG's ability to access up-to-date information and fine-tuning's capacity to embed nuanced domain understanding. We further explored optimization strategies for the response generation logic, experimenting with settings to balance response quality and speed, aiming for consistently high-quality outputs that meet the specific requirements of admissions communications."}

We study whether a single flow-matching foundation model pre-trained primarily on RGB images can be repurposed as a cross-spectral translator using only a few co-measured examples, and whether the resulting synthetic data can enhance downstream detection. Starting from FLUX.1 Kontext, we insert low-rank adaptation (LoRA) modules and fine-tune them on just 100 paired images per domain for two settings: RGB to IR on the KAIST dataset and RGB to SAR on the M4-SAR dataset. The adapted model translates RGB images into pixel-aligned IR/SAR, enabling us to reuse existing bounding boxes and train object detection models purely in the target modality. Across a grid of LoRA hyperparameters, we find that LPIPS computed on only 50 held-out pairs is a strong proxy for downstream performance: lower LPIPS consistently predicts higher mAP for YOLOv11n on both IR and SAR, and for DETR on KAIST IR test data. Using the best LPIPS-selected LoRA adapter, synthetic IR from external RGB datasets (LLVIP, FLIR ADAS) improves KAIST IR pedestrian detection, and synthetic SAR significantly boosts infrastructure detection on M4-SAR when combined with limited real SAR. Our results suggest that few-shot LoRA adaptation of flow-matching foundation models is a promising path toward foundation-style support for non-visible modalities."}

Rather than asking ''which components are necessary,'' we ask ''how does the model organize computation?'' Our analysis reveals a coherent computational architecture comprising four interlocking mechanisms: Staged Computation (layer-wise processing phases), Information Transmission (information flow aggregation at boundary tokens), Fact Retrospection (persistent re-access of source facts), and Specialized Attention Heads (functionally distinct head types). These mechanisms generalize across model scales, rule types, and reasoning depths, providing mechanistic evidence that LLMs employ structured computational strategies for logical reasoning."}

Intelligence is defined as the capacity to form and integrate causal connections between signals, actions, and internal states. Through context enrichment, systems interpret incoming information using learned relational structure that provides essential context in an efficient representation that the raw input itself does not contain, enabling efficient processing under metabolic constraints.\n  Building on this foundation, we introduce the systems-explaining-systems principle, where consciousness emerges when recursive architectures allow higher-order systems to learn and interpret the relational patterns of lower-order systems across time. These interpretations are integrated into a dynamically stabilized meta-state and fed back through context enrichment, transforming internal models from representations of the external world into models of the system's own cognitive processes.\n  The framework reframes predictive processing as an emergent consequence of contextual interpretation rather than explicit forecasting and suggests that recursive multi-system architectures may be necessary for more human-like artificial intelligence."}

Prevailing explainable AI techniques rely on post hoc numerical feature attributions, which fail to provide coherent narratives behind model decisions. Large language models (LLMs) present an opportunity to generate natural-language explanations, but three design challenges remain unresolved: explanations must be both decision-correct and faithful to the factors that drive the prediction; they should be able to serve multiple audiences without shifting the underlying decision rule; and they should be trained in a label-efficient way that does not depend on large corpora of human-scored explanations. To address these challenges, we introduce LEXMA (LLM-based EXplanations for Multi-Audience decisions), a reinforcement-learning-based fine-tuning framework that produces narrative-driven, audience-appropriate explanations. LEXMA combines reflection-augmented supervised fine-tuning with two stages of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Specifically, it fine-tunes two separate parameter sets to improve decision correctness and satisfy stylistic requirements for different audiences, using reward signals that do not rely on human-annotated explanations. We instantiate LEXMA in the context of mortgage approval decisions. Results demonstrate that LEXMA yields significant improvements in predictive performance compared with other LLM baselines. Moreover, human evaluations show that expert-facing explanations generated by our approach are more risk-focused, and consumer-facing explanations are clearer, more actionable, and more polite.

In this paper, we show how automated common-sense reasoning technology can be deployed in situations where there are not enough data samples available to train a deep learning-based AV model that can handle certain abnormal road scenarios. Specifically, we consider two situations where (i) a traffic signal is malfunctioning at an intersection and (ii) all the cars ahead are slowing down and steering away due to an unexpected obstruction (e.g., animals on the road). We show that in such situations, our commonsense reasoning-based solution accurately detects traffic light colors and obstacles not correctly captured by the AV's perception model. We also provide a pathway for efficiently invoking commonsense reasoning by measuring uncertainty in the computer vision model and using commonsense reasoning to handle uncertain scenarios.

An important step in this procedure is mastoidectomy, which removes part of the mastoid region of the temporal bone to provide surgical access. Accurate mastoidectomy shape prediction from preoperative imaging improves pre-surgical planning, reduces risks, and enhances surgical outcomes. Despite its importance, there are limited deep-learning-based studies regarding this topic due to the challenges of acquiring ground-truth labels. We address this gap by investigating self-supervised and weakly-supervised learning models to predict the mastoidectomy region without human annotations. We propose a hybrid self-supervised and weakly-supervised learning framework to predict the mastoidectomy region directly from preoperative CT scans, where the mastoid remains intact. Our hybrid method achieves a mean Dice score of 0.72 when predicting the complex and boundary-less mastoidectomy shape, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches and demonstrating strong performance. The method provides groundwork for constructing 3D postmastoidectomy surfaces directly from the corresponding preoperative CT scans. To our knowledge, this is the first work that integrating self-supervised and weakly-supervised learning for mastoidectomy shape prediction, offering a robust and efficient solution for CI surgical planning while leveraging 3D T-distribution loss in weakly-supervised medical imaging."}

However, such slow-thinking approaches often lead to overthinking, where models produce excessively verbose responses even for simple queries, resulting in test-time inefficiency and even degraded accuracy. Prior work has attempted to mitigate this issue via adaptive reasoning strategies, but these methods largely overlook a fundamental bottleneck: visual perception failures. We argue that stable reasoning critically depends on low-level visual grounding, and that reasoning errors often originate from imperfect perception rather than insufficient deliberation. To address this limitation, we propose Gated Perception-Reasoning Optimization (GPRO), a meta-reasoning controller that dynamically routes computation among three decision paths at each generation step: a lightweight fast path, a slow perception path for re-examining visual inputs, and a slow reasoning path for internal self-reflection. To learn this distinction, we derive large-scale failure attribution supervision from approximately 790k samples, using teacher models to distinguish perceptual hallucinations from reasoning errors. We then train the controller with multi-objective reinforcement learning to optimize the trade-off between task accuracy and computational cost under uncertainty. Experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate that GPRO substantially improves both accuracy and efficiency, outperforming recent slow-thinking methods while generating significantly shorter responses."}

UniDrive-WM's trajectory planner predicts a future trajectory, which conditions a VLM-based image generator to produce plausible future frames.

This paper outlines Agent Mallard, a forward-planning, rules-based agent for tactical control in systemised airspace that embeds a stochastic digital twin directly into its conflict-resolution loop. Mallard operates on predefined GPS-guided routes, reducing continuous 4D vectoring to discrete choices over lanes and levels, and constructs hierarchical plans from an expert-informed library of deconfliction strategies. A depth-limited backtracking search uses causal attribution, topological plan splicing, and monotonic axis constraints to seek a complete safe plan for all aircraft, validating each candidate manoeuvre against uncertain execution scenarios (e.g., wind variation, pilot response, communication loss) before commitment.\n  Preliminary walkthroughs with UK controllers and initial tests in the BluebirdDT airspace digital twin indicate that Mallard's behaviour aligns with expert reasoning and resolves conflicts in simplified scenarios. The architecture is intended to combine model-based safety assessment, interpretable decision logic, and tractable computational performance in future structured en-route environments."}

Using controlled multi-agent simulations across Ultimatum, Buy-Sell, and Resource Exchange games, we systematically isolate language effects across English and four Indic framings (Hindi, Punjabi, Gujarati, Marwadi) by holding game rules, model parameters, and incentives constant across all conditions. We find that language choice can shift outcomes more strongly than changing models, reversing proposer advantages and reallocating surplus. Crucially, effects are task-contingent: Indic languages reduce stability in distributive games yet induce richer exploration in integrative settings. Our results demonstrate that evaluating LLM negotiation solely in English yields incomplete and potentially misleading conclusions. These findings caution against English-only evaluation of LLMs and suggest that culturally-aware evaluation is essential for fair deployment."}

Nevertheless, the synthesized texture UV map usually comes from a space constructed by the training data or the 2D face generator, which limits the methods' generalization ability for in-the-wild input images. Consequently, their facial details, structures and identity may not be consistent with the input. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing a style transfer-based facial texture refinement method named FaceRefiner. FaceRefiner treats the 3D sampled texture as style and the output of a texture generation method as content. The photo-realistic style is then expected to be transferred from the style image to the content image. Different from current style transfer methods that only transfer high and middle level information to the result, our style transfer method integrates differentiable rendering to also transfer low level (or pixel level) information in the visible face regions. The main benefit of such multi-level information transfer is that, the details, structures and semantics in the input can thus be well preserved. The extensive experiments on Multi-PIE, CelebA and FFHQ datasets demonstrate that our refinement method can improve the texture quality and the face identity preserving ability, compared with state-of-the-arts."}

The evaluation results show that RepMD achieves the highest accuracy with 81.1% and has slight accuracy decreases when generalized to type-shifting and temporal-evolving memes. Human evaluation shows that RepMD can improve the efficiency of human discovery on harmful memes, with 15$\\sim$30 seconds per meme."}

To overcome these limitations, we propose Disco-RAG, a discourse-aware framework that explicitly injects discourse signals into the generation process. Our method constructs intra-chunk discourse trees to capture local hierarchies and builds inter-chunk rhetorical graphs to model cross-passage coherence. These structures are jointly integrated into a planning blueprint that conditions the generation.

The development of accurate machine learning-based segmentation models remains challenging due to the limited availability of data and the complexity of anatomical structures. In this work, we investigate 3D conditional generative models as potential solution for augmenting scarce LGE training data and improving LA segmentation performance. We develop a pipeline to synthesize high-fidelity 3D LGE MRI volumes from composite semantic label maps combining anatomical expert annotations with unsupervised tissue clusters, using three 3D conditional generators (Pix2Pix GAN, SPADE-GAN, and SPADE-LDM). The synthetic images are evaluated for realism and their impact on downstream LA segmentation. SPADE-LDM generates the most realistic and structurally accurate images, achieving an FID of 4.063 and surpassing GAN models, which have FIDs of 40.821 and 7.652 for Pix2Pix and SPADE-GAN, respectively. When augmented with synthetic LGE images, the Dice score for LA cavity segmentation with a 3D U-Net model improved from 0.908 to 0.936, showing a statistically significant improvement (p < 0.05) over the baseline.These findings demonstrate the potential of label-conditioned 3D synthesis to enhance the segmentation of under-represented cardiac structures."}

Prior work that uses the Stereotype Content Model (SCM) has focused mostly on single-group bias along warmth and competence. We broaden that lens to intersectional bias by building compound representations for pairs of social identities through summation or concatenation, and by applying three debiasing strategies: Subtraction, Linear Projection, and Partial Projection. We study three widely used embedding families (Word2Vec, GloVe, and ConceptNet Numberbatch) and assess them with two complementary views of utility: whether local neighborhoods remain coherent and whether analogy behavior is preserved. Across models, SCM-based mitigation carries over well to the intersectional case and largely keeps the overall semantic landscape intact. The main cost is a familiar trade off: methods that most tightly preserve geometry tend to be more cautious about analogy behavior, while more assertive projections can improve analogies at the expense of strict neighborhood stability. Partial Projection is reliably conservative and keeps representations steady; Linear Projection can be more assertive; Subtraction is a simple baseline that remains competitive. The choice between summation and concatenation depends on the embedding family and the application goal. Together, these findings suggest that intersectional debiasing with SCM is practical in static embeddings, and they offer guidance for selecting aggregation and debiasing settings when balancing stability against analogy performance."}

Prior work largely overlooks multi-layer design document editing, focusing instead on single-layer image editing or multi-layer generation, which assume a flat canvas and lack the reasoning needed to determine what and where to modify. To address this gap, we introduce the Multi-Layer Document Editing Agent (MiLDEAgent), a reasoning-based framework that combines an RL-trained multimodal reasoner for layer-wise understanding with an image editor for targeted modifications. To systematically benchmark this setting, we introduce the MiLDEBench, a human-in-the-loop corpus of over 20K design documents paired with diverse editing instructions. The benchmark is complemented by a task-specific evaluation protocol, MiLDEEval, which spans four dimensions including instruction following, layout consistency, aesthetics, and text rendering. Extensive experiments on 14 open-source and 2 closed-source models reveal that existing approaches fail to generalize: open-source models often cannot complete multi-layer document editing tasks, while closed-source models suffer from format violations. In contrast, MiLDEAgent achieves strong layer-aware reasoning and precise editing, significantly outperforming all open-source baselines and attaining performance comparable to closed-source models, thereby establishing the first strong baseline for multi-layer document editing."}

We term this Transitive Expert Error (TEE), distinct from Dunning-Kruger effects, requiring calibrated expertise as precondition. Mechanisms enabling reliable within-domain judgment become liabilities when structural similarity masks causal divergence. Two core mechanisms operate: structural similarity bias causes experts to overweight surface features (shared vocabulary, patterns, formal structure) while missing causal architecture differences; authority persistence maintains confidence across competence boundaries through social reinforcement and metacognitive failures (experts experience no subjective uncertainty as pattern recognition operates smoothly on familiar-seeming inputs.) These mechanism intensify under three conditions: shared vocabulary masking divergent processes, social pressure for immediate judgment, and delayed feedback. These findings extend to AI routing architectures (MoE systems, multi-model orchestration, tool-using agents, RAG systems) exhibiting routing-induced failures (wrong specialist selected) and coverage-induced failures (no appropriate specialist exists). Both produce a hallucination phenotype: confident, coherent, structurally plausible but causally incorrect outputs at domain boundaries. In human systems where mechanisms are cognitive black boxes; AI architectures make them explicit and addressable. We propose interventions: multi-expert activation with disagreement detection (router level), boundary-aware calibration (specialist level), and coverage gap detection (training level). TEE has detectable signatures (routing patterns, confidence-accuracy dissociations, domain-inappropriate content) enabling monitoring and mitigation. What remains intractable in human cognition becomes addressable through architectural design."}

In recent years, LLMs have demonstrated remarkable performance in a wide range of tasks. However, they still lack human cognition to balance factuality and safety. Bearing the resemblance, we argue that both factual and safety failures in LLMs arise from a representational misalignment in their latent activation space, rather than addressing those as entirely separate alignment issues. We hypothesize that an external network, trained to understand the fluctuations, can selectively intervene in the model to regulate falsehood into truthfulness and unsafe output into safe output without fine-tuning the model parameters themselves. Reflecting the hypothesis, we propose ARREST (Adversarial Resilient Regulation Enhancing Safety and Truth), a unified framework that identifies and corrects drifted features, engaging both soft and hard refusals in addition to factual corrections. Our empirical results show that ARREST not only regulates misalignment but is also more versatile compared to the RLHF-aligned models in generating soft refusals due to adversarial training.

We study this through next-turn dialogue prediction: given a conversation, predict the next utterance produced by a person. We compare learning approaches along two dimensions: (1) whether the model is allowed to think before responding, and (2) how learning is rewarded either through an LLM-as-a-judge that scores semantic similarity and information completeness relative to the ground-truth response, or by directly maximizing the log-probability of the true human dialogue. We find that optimizing for judge-based rewards indeed increases judge scores throughout training, however it decreases the likelihood assigned to ground truth human responses and decreases the win rate when human judges choose the most human-like response among a real and synthetic option. This failure is amplified when the model is allowed to think before answering. In contrast, by directly maximizing the log-probability of observed human responses, the model learns to better predict what people actually say, improving on both log-probability and win rate evaluations. Treating chain-of-thought as a latent variable, we derive a lower bound on the log-probability. Optimizing this objective yields the best results on all our evaluations.

Furthermore, Auxiliary Deep Supervision (ADS) heads are added at multiple scales to both decoders, providing more accurate gradient feedback and further enhancing the discriminative capability of multi-scale features. We conduct extensive experiments on three datasets: the NIH Pancreas dataset, the MSD dataset, and a clinical pancreatic tumor dataset provided by collaborating hospitals. DB-MSMUNet achieves Dice Similarity Coefficients of 89.47%, 87.59%, and 89.02%, respectively, outperforming most existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of segmentation accuracy, edge preservation, and robustness across different datasets. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed method for real-world pancreatic CT segmentation tasks."}

However, their reliance on large-scale datasets-often collected from human or web sources-makes them vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where adversaries poison a small subset of data to implant hidden behaviors. Despite this growing risk, defenses for instruction-tuned models remain underexplored. We propose MB-Defense (Merging & Breaking Defense Framework), a novel training pipeline that immunizes instruction-tuned LLMs against diverse backdoor threats. MB-Defense comprises two stages: (i) defensive poisoning, which merges attacker and defensive triggers into a unified backdoor representation, and (ii) weight recovery, which breaks this representation through additional training to restore clean behavior. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs show that MB-Defense substantially lowers attack success rates while preserving instruction-following ability. Our method offers a generalizable and data-efficient defense strategy, improving the robustness of instruction-tuned LLMs against unseen backdoor attacks."}

Existing video super-resolution (VSR) methods either neglect the inherent modality gap between infrared and visible images or fail to restore turbulence-induced distortions. Directly cascading turbulence mitigation (TM) algorithms with VSR methods leads to error propagation and accumulation due to the decoupled modeling of degradation between turbulence and resolution. We introduce HATIR, a Heat-Aware Diffusion for Turbulent InfraRed Video Super-Resolution, which injects heat-aware deformation priors into the diffusion sampling path to jointly model the inverse process of turbulent degradation and structural detail loss. Specifically, HATIR constructs a Phasor-Guided Flow Estimator, rooted in the physical principle that thermally active regions exhibit consistent phasor responses over time, enabling reliable turbulence-aware flow to guide the reverse diffusion process. To ensure the fidelity of structural recovery under nonuniform distortions, a Turbulence-Aware Decoder is proposed to selectively suppress unstable temporal cues and enhance edge-aware feature aggregation via turbulence gating and structure-aware attention. We built FLIR-IVSR, the first dataset for turbulent infrared VSR, comprising paired LR-HR sequences from a FLIR T1050sc camera (1024 X 768) spanning 640 diverse scenes with varying camera and object motion conditions.

In the first stage, self-supervised contrastive learning is employed with a dynamic dictionary update mechanism to extract robust representations from large amounts of the unlabeled data. In the second stage, supervised training on a small labeled dataset is performed, where the contrastive and cross-entropy losses are jointly optimized to improve the feature separability and strengthen the classification boundaries. In the third stage, an AL module selects the most valuable samples from the unlabeled data for annotation based on the uncertainty and representativeness criteria, further enhancing generalization under limited labeling budgets. Experimental results on the ADS-B and WiFi datasets demonstrate that the proposed SEI approach significantly outperforms the conventional supervised and semi-supervised methods under limited annotation conditions, achieving higher recognition accuracy with lower labeling cost."}

Most research focuses on how to organize and use memory summary, but often overlooks the initial memory extraction stage. In this paper, we argue that existing summary-based methods have two major limitations based on the recurrent processing theory. First, summarization is \"ahead-of-time\", acting as a blind \"feed-forward\" process that misses important details because it doesn't know future tasks. Second, extraction is usually \"one-off\", lacking a feedback loop to verify facts, which leads to the accumulation of information loss. To address these issues, we propose proactive memory extraction (namely ProMem). Unlike static summarization, ProMem treats extraction as an iterative cognitive process. We introduce a recurrent feedback loop where the agent uses self-questioning to actively probe the dialogue history. This mechanism allows the agent to recover missing information and correct errors. Our ProMem significantly improves the completeness of the extracted memory and QA accuracy. It also achieves a superior trade-off between extraction quality and token cost."}

However, how understanding can effectively assist generation has not been fully explored. Unlike previous works that focus on leveraging reasoning abilities and world knowledge from understanding models, this paper introduces a novel perspective: leveraging understanding to enhance the fidelity and detail richness of generated images. To this end, we propose Forge-and-Quench, a new unified framework that puts this principle into practice. In the generation process of our framework, an MLLM first reasons over the entire conversational context, including text instructions, to produce an enhanced text instruction. This refined instruction is then mapped to a virtual visual representation, termed the Bridge Feature, via a novel Bridge Adapter. This feature acts as a crucial link, forging insights from the understanding model to quench and refine the generation process. It is subsequently injected into the T2I backbone as a visual guidance signal, alongside the enhanced text instruction that replaces the original input. To validate this paradigm, we conduct comprehensive studies on the design of the Bridge Feature and Bridge Adapter. Our framework demonstrates exceptional extensibility and flexibility, enabling efficient migration across different MLLM and T2I models with significant savings in training overhead, all without compromising the MLLM's inherent multimodal understanding capabilities. Experiments show that Forge-and-Quench significantly improves image fidelity and detail across multiple models, while also maintaining instruction-following accuracy and enhancing world knowledge application.

However, this architecture is inherently limited by the local-oriented mechanism, leading to restricted representation power and hindering neural approaches for MILP. Here we present an attention-driven neural architecture that learns expressive representations beyond the pure graph view. A dual-attention mechanism is designed to perform parallel self- and cross-attention over variables and constraints, enabling global information exchange and deeper representation learning. We apply this general backbone to various downstream tasks at the instance level, element level, and solving state level.

First, we study hallucinations in closed-book question answering on HotpotQA and find a directional effect: negating the hallucination token reduces hallucinated answers mainly by increasing abstentions, whereas asserting it increases hallucinations and lowers precision. Second, we induce recasting, a pedagogical feedback strategy for second language teaching, and observe the same directional effect. Moreover, compared to providing the full definitional corpus in-context, concept tokens better preserve compliance with other instructions (e.g., asking follow-up questions).

Existing routing strategies generally fall into two categories: performance routing, which balances latency and cost across models of different sizes, and task routing, which assigns queries to domain-specific experts to improve accuracy. In real-world enterprise applications, task routing is more suitable; however, most existing approaches rely on static single-label decisions, which introduce two major limitations: (i) difficulty in seamlessly integrating new agents as business domains expand, and (ii) routing conflicts caused by overlapping agent capabilities, ultimately degrading accuracy and robustness.To address these challenges, we propose TCAndon-Router(TCAR): an adaptive reasoning router for multi-agent collaboration. Unlike traditional routers, TCAR supports dynamic agent onboarding and first generates a natural-language reasoning chain before predicting a set of candidate agents capable of handling the query. In addition, we design a collaborative execution pipeline in which selected agents independently produce responses, which are then aggregated and refined into a single high-quality response by a dedicated Refining Agent.Experiments on public datasets and real enterprise data demonstrate that TCAR significantly improves routing accuracy, reduces routing conflicts, and remains robust in ambiguous scenarios.

Long term operation of such AI enabled human centric applications can expose them to corner cases for which their operation is may be uncertain. This can be due to many reasons such as inherent flaws in the design, limited resources for testing, inherent computational limitations of the testing methodology, or unknown use cases resulting from human interaction with the system. Such untested corner cases or cases for which the system performance is uncertain can lead to violations in the safety, sustainability, and security requirements of the system.

This work presents the first systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art text watermarking methods: KGW, Exponential Sampling (EXP), and Waterfall, for Bangla LLM text generation under cross-lingual round-trip translation (RTT) attacks. Under benign conditions, KGW and EXP achieve high detection accuracy (>88%) with negligible perplexity and ROUGE degradation.

This paper introduces a novel segmentation-driven monocular SfP (SMSfP) framework that reformulates global shape recovery into a set of local reconstructions over adaptively segmented convex sub-regions. Specifically, a polarization-aided adaptive region growing (PARG) segmentation strategy is proposed to decompose the global convexity assumption into locally convex regions, effectively suppressing azimuth ambiguities and preserving surface continuity. Furthermore, a multi-scale fusion convexity prior (MFCP) constraint is developed to ensure local surface consistency and enhance the recovery of fine textural and structural details.

Backdoor triggers injected into specific stages of an agent workflow can persist through multiple intermediate states and adversely influence downstream outputs. However, existing studies remain fragmented and typically analyze individual attack vectors in isolation, leaving the cross-stage interaction and propagation of backdoor triggers poorly understood from an agent-centric perspective. To fill this gap, we propose \\textbf{BackdoorAgent}, a modular and stage-aware framework that provides a unified, agent-centric view of backdoor threats in LLM agents. BackdoorAgent structures the attack surface into three functional stages of agentic workflows, including \\textbf{planning attacks}, \\textbf{memory attacks}, and \\textbf{tool-use attacks}, and instruments agent execution to enable systematic analysis of trigger activation and propagation across different stages.

Moreover, these approaches focus only on supportive neurons that correlate positively with task completion, while neglecting neurons with other roles-such as inhibitive roles-and misled neuron attribution due to fortuitous behaviors in LLMs (i.e., correctly answer the questions by chance rather than genuine understanding). To address these challenges, we propose NeuronLLM, a novel task-level LLM understanding framework that adopts the biological principle of functional antagonism for LLM neuron identification. The key insight is that task performance is jointly determined by neurons with two opposing roles: good neurons that facilitate task completion and bad neurons that inhibit it. NeuronLLM achieves a holistic modeling of neurons via contrastive learning of good and bad neurons, while leveraging augmented question sets to mitigate the fortuitous behaviors in LLMs. Comprehensive experiments on LLMs of different sizes and families show the superiority of NeuronLLM over existing methods in four NLP tasks, providing new insights into LLM functional organization."}

To support this, we systematically categorize and organize existing multi-image grounding tasks according to their reliance of cross-image cues and reasoning, and introduce the MG-Data-240K dataset, addressing the limitations of existing datasets regarding target quantity and image relation. To tackle the challenges of robustly handling diverse multi-image grounding tasks, we further propose a hybrid reinforcement finetuning strategy that integrates chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and direct answering, considering their complementary strengths.

This lack of transparency complicates interpretability, hinders debugging efforts, and erodes trust, especially in high-stakes domains where clear decision-making is essential. To address these challenges, we introduce the concept of Neurosymbolic RAG, which integrates symbolic reasoning using a knowledge graph with neural retrieval techniques. This new framework aims to answer two primary questions: (a) Can retrievers provide a clear and interpretable basis for document selection? (b) Can symbolic knowledge enhance the clarity of the retrieval process? We propose three methods to improve this integration. First is MAR (Knowledge Modulation Aligned Retrieval) that employs modulation networks to refine query embeddings using interpretable symbolic features, thereby making document matching more explicit. Second, KG-Path RAG enhances queries by traversing knowledge graphs to improve overall retrieval quality and interpretability. Lastly, Process Knowledge-infused RAG utilizes domain-specific tools to reorder retrieved content based on validated workflows.

FeedEval employs dimension-specialized LLM evaluators trained on datasets curated in this study to assess multiple feedback candidates and select high-quality feedback for downstream use. Experiments on the ASAP++ benchmark show that FeedEval closely aligns with human expert judgments and that essay scoring models trained with FeedEval-filtered high-quality feedback achieve superior scoring performance.

However, accurately estimating depth from 2D images continues to be a persistent and fundamental challenge in the field of 3D recovery. Heuristic approaches involve with the ill-posed problem for inferring the spatial variant defocusing blur, as the desired blur cannot be distinguished from the inherent blur. Given a prior knowledge of the defocus model, the problem become well-posed with an analytic solution for the relative blur between two images, taken at the same viewpoint with different camera settings for the focus. The Gaussian model stands out as an optimal choice for real-time applications, due to its mathematical simplicity and computational efficiency. And theoretically, it is the only model can be applied at the same time to both the absolute blur caused by depth in a single image and the relative blur resulting from depth differences between two images. This paper introduces the settings, for conventional imaging devices, to ensure that the defocusing operator adheres to the Gaussian model. Defocus analysis begins within the framework of geometric optics and is conducted by defocus aberration theory in diffraction-limited optics to obtain the accuracy of fitting the actual model to its Gaussian approximation. The results for a typical set of focused depths between $1$ and $100$ meters, with a maximum depth variation of $10\\%$ at the focused depth, confirm the Gaussian model's applicability for defocus operators in most imaging devices.

However, these methods face significant challenges when applied to multi-hop reasoning tasks requiring knowledge chaining. In this work, we study the effect of editing knowledge with ROME on different layer depths and identify three key failure modes. First, the \"hopping-too-late\" problem occurs as later layers lack access to necessary intermediate representations. Second, generalization ability deteriorates sharply when editing later layers. Third, the model overfits to edited knowledge, incorrectly prioritizing edited-hop answers regardless of context. To mitigate the issues of \"hopping-too-late\" and generalisation decay, we propose Redundant Editing, a simple yet effective strategy that enhances multi-hop reasoning. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach can improve accuracy on 2-hop questions by at least 15.5 percentage points, representing a 96% increase over the previous single-edit strategy, while trading off some specificity and language naturalness."}

Since Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) provide generic priors, several studies have explored their potential as domain-agnostic zero-shot inverse solvers. Despite these efforts, existing latent diffusion inverse solvers suffer from their instability, exhibiting undesirable artifacts and degraded quality. In this work, we first identify the instability as a discrepancy between the solver's and true reverse diffusion dynamics, and show that reducing this gap stabilizes the solver. Building on this, we introduce Measurement-Consistent Langevin Corrector (MCLC), a theoretically grounded plug-and-play correction module that remedies the LDM-based inverse solvers through measurement-consistent Langevin updates. Compared to prior approaches that rely on linear manifold assumptions, which often do not hold in latent space, MCLC operates without this assumption, leading to more stable and reliable behavior. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of MCLC and its compatibility with existing solvers across diverse image restoration tasks. Additionally, we analyze blob artifacts and offer insights into their underlying causes. We highlight that MCLC is a key step toward more robust zero-shot inverse problem solvers."}

This survey systematizes the emerging landscape of agent-blockchain interoperability through a systematic literature review, identifying 317 relevant works from an initial pool of over 3000 records. We contribute a five-part taxonomy of integration patterns spanning read-only analytics, simulation and intent generation, delegated execution, autonomous signing, and multi-agent workflows; a threat model tailored to agent-driven transaction pipelines that captures risks ranging from prompt injection and policy misuse to key compromise, adversarial execution dynamics, and multi-agent collusion; and a comparative capability matrix analyzing more than 20 representative systems across 13 dimensions, including custody models, permissioning, policy enforcement, observability, and recovery. Building on the gaps revealed by this analysis, we outline a research roadmap centered on two interface abstractions: a Transaction Intent Schema for portable and unambiguous goal specification, and a Policy Decision Record for auditable, verifiable policy enforcement across execution environments.

In current systems, however, description specificity is often conflated with their length. We argue that these two concepts must be disentangled: descriptions can be concise yet dense with information, or lengthy yet vacuous. We define specificity relative to a contrast set, where a description is more specific to the extent that it picks out the target image better than other possible images. We construct a dataset that controls for length while varying information content, and validate that people reliably prefer more specific descriptions regardless of length. We find that controlling for length alone cannot account for differences in specificity: how the length budget is allocated makes a difference. These results support evaluation approaches that directly prioritize specificity over verbosity."}

Human evaluators, on the other hand, use a greater variety of language signs and retain more consistent confidence.

While detector-based approaches typically achieve strong frame-level accuracy, they often suffer from temporal inconsistencies caused by frequent detection dropouts. Despite its practical relevance, research on RGB-based drone tracking is still limited and largely reliant on conventional motion models. Meanwhile, foundation models like SAMURAI have established their effectiveness across other domains, exhibiting strong category-agnostic tracking performance. However, their applicability in drone-specific scenarios has not been investigated yet. Motivated by this gap, we present the first systematic evaluation of SAMURAI's potential for robust drone tracking in urban surveillance settings. Furthermore, we introduce a detector-augmented extension of SAMURAI to mitigate sensitivity to bounding-box initialization and sequence length. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed extension significantly improves robustness in complex urban environments, with pronounced benefits in long-duration sequences - especially under drone exit-re-entry events. The incorporation of detector cues yields consistent gains over SAMURAI's zero-shot performance across datasets and metrics, with success rate improvements of up to +0.393 and FNR reductions of up to -0.475."}

While these approaches can raise aggregate scores, they often yield unstable and hard-to-audit improvement trajectories, making it difficult to guarantee non-regression or to reason about failures across versions. We reframe agent improvement as \\textbf{release engineering}: agents are treated as shippable artifacts, and improvement is externalized into a regression-aware release pipeline. We introduce \\textbf{AgentDevel}, a release engineering pipeline that iteratively runs the current agent, produces implementation-blind, symptom-level quality signals from execution traces, synthesizes a single release candidate (RC) via executable diagnosis, and promotes it under flip-centered gating. AgentDevel features three core designs: (i) an implementation-blind LLM critic that characterizes failure appearances without accessing agent internals, (ii) script-based executable diagnosis that aggregates dominant symptom patterns and produces auditable engineering specifications, and (iii) flip-centered gating that prioritizes pass to fail regressions and fail to pass fixes as first-class evidence. Unlike population-based search or in-agent self-refinement, AgentDevel maintains a single canonical version line and emphasizes non-regression as a primary objective. Experiments on execution-heavy benchmarks demonstrate that AgentDevel yields stable improvements with significantly fewer regressions while producing reproducible, auditable artifacts. Overall, AgentDevel provides a practical development discipline for building, debugging, and releasing LLM agents as software development."}

Estimating when a document was written and tracing the development of scripts and writing styles can be aided by identifying the individual scribes who contributed to a medieval manuscript. Although digital technologies have made significant progress in this field, the general problem remains unsolved and continues to pose open challenges. ... We previously proposed an approach focused on identifying specific letters or abbreviations that characterize each writer. In that study, we considered the letter \"a\", as it was widely present on all pages of text and highly distinctive, according to the suggestions of expert paleographers. We used template matching techniques to detect the occurrences of the character \"a\" on each page and the convolutional neural network (CNN) to attribute each instance to the correct scribe. Moving from the interesting results achieved from this previous system and being aware of the limitations of the template matching technique, which requires an appropriate threshold to work, we decided to experiment in the same framework with the use of the YOLO object detection model to identify the scribe who contributed to the writing of different medieval books. We considered the fifth version of YOLO to implement the YOLO object detection model, which completely substituted the template matching and CNN used in the previous work. The experimental results demonstrate that YOLO effectively extracts a greater number of letters considered, leading to a more accurate second-stage classification. Furthermore, the YOLO confidence score provides a foundation for developing a system that applies a rejection threshold, enabling reliable writer identification even in unseen manuscripts."}

However, existing frameworks rely heavily on natural language reasoning to determine when tools can be invoked and whether their results should be committed, lacking formal guarantees for logical safety and verifiability. We present \\textbf{ToolGate}, a forward execution framework that provides logical safety guarantees and verifiable state evolution for LLM tool calling. ToolGate maintains an explicit symbolic state space as a typed key-value mapping representing trusted world information throughout the reasoning process. Each tool is formalized as a Hoare-style contract consisting of a precondition and a postcondition, where the precondition gates tool invocation by checking whether the current state satisfies the required conditions, and the postcondition determines whether the tool's result can be committed to update the state through runtime verification. Our approach guarantees that the symbolic state evolves only through verified tool executions, preventing invalid or hallucinated results from corrupting the world representation. Experimental validation demonstrates that ToolGate significantly improves the reliability and verifiability of tool-augmented LLM systems while maintaining competitive performance on complex multi-step reasoning tasks. This work establishes a foundation for building more trustworthy and debuggable AI systems that integrate language models with external tools."}

In industrial settings such as pharmaceutical content understanding, practitioners must process long-form videos under strict GPU, latency, and cost constraints, where many existing approaches fail to scale. In this work, we present an industrial GenAI framework that processes over 200,000 PDFs, 25,326 videos across eight formats (e.g., MP4, M4V, etc.), and 888 multilingual audio files in more than 20 languages. Our study makes three contributions: (i) an industrial large-scale architecture for multimodal reasoning in pharmaceutical domains; (ii) empirical analysis of over 40 VLMs on two leading benchmarks (Video-MME and MMBench) and proprietary dataset of 25,326 videos across 14 disease areas; and (iii) four findings relevant to long-form video reasoning: the role of multimodality, attention mechanism trade-offs, temporal reasoning limits, and challenges of video splitting under GPU constraints. Results show 3-8 times efficiency gains with SDPA attention on commodity GPUs, multimodality improving up to 8/12 task domains (especially length-dependent tasks), and clear bottlenecks in temporal alignment and keyframe detection across open- and closed-source VLMs. Rather than proposing a new \"A+B\" model, this paper characterizes practical limits, trade-offs, and failure patterns of current VLMs under realistic deployment constraints, and provide actionable guidance for both researchers and practitioners designing scalable multimodal systems for long-form video understanding in industrial domains."}

Traditional quantifier instantiation methods struggle because they lack semantic understanding of UF constraints, forcing them to search through unbounded solution spaces with limited guidance. We present AquaForte, a framework that leverages Large Language Models to provide semantic guidance for UF instantiation by generating instantiated candidates for function definitions that satisfy the constraints, thereby significantly reducing the search space and complexity for solvers. Our approach preprocesses formulas through constraint separation, uses structured prompts to extract mathematical reasoning from LLMs, and integrates the results with traditional SMT algorithms through adaptive instantiation. AquaForte maintains soundness through systematic validation: LLM-guided instantiations yielding SAT solve the original problem, while UNSAT results generate exclusion clauses for iterative refinement. Completeness is preserved by fallback to traditional solvers augmented with learned constraints. Experimental evaluation on SMT-COMP benchmarks demonstrates that AquaForte solves numerous instances where state-of-the-art solvers like Z3 and CVC5 timeout, with particular effectiveness on satisfiable formulas.

Further, since curating large annotated datasets for meme moderation is prohibitively expensive, we propose a novel framework that leverages task-specific generative multimodal agents and the few-shot adaptability of large multimodal models to cater to different types of memes.

In this work, we study the resilience of LLM-based MAS under perturbations and find that both the communication topology and prompt design significantly influence system resilience. Motivated by these findings, we propose ResMAS: a two-stage framework for enhancing MAS resilience. First, we train a reward model to predict the MAS's resilience, based on which we train a topology generator to automatically design resilient topology for specific tasks through reinforcement learning. Second, we introduce a topology-aware prompt optimization method that refines each agent's prompt based on its connections and interactions with other agents.

We introduce a controlled contrastive benchmark \\textsc{\\textbf{ProtoBias}} (\\textit{\\textbf{Proto}typical \\textbf{Bias}}), spanning Animals, Objects, and Demography images, where semantically correct but non-prototypical images are paired with subtly incorrect yet prototypical adversarial counterparts.

Under Review", "summary": "Current techniques for post-training Large Language Models (LLMs) rely either on costly human supervision or on external verifiers to boost performance on tasks such as mathematical reasoning and code generation. However, as LLMs improve their problem-solving, any further improvement will potentially require high-quality solutions to difficult problems that are not available to humans. As a result, learning from unlabeled data is becoming increasingly attractive in the research community. Existing methods extract learning signal from a model's consistency, either by majority voting or by converting the model's internal confidence into reward. Although internal consistency metric such as entropy or self-certainty require no human intervention, as we show in this work, these are unreliable signals for large-scale and long-term training. To address the unreliability, we propose PRISM, a unified training framework that uses a Process Reward Model (PRM) to guide learning alongside model's internal confidence in the absence of ground-truth labels. We show that effectively combining PRM with self-certainty can lead to both stable training and better test-time performance, and also keep the model's internal confidence in check."}

To address this issue, we propose TEA, a TEmporal Adaptive SITS semantic segmentation method to enhance the model's resilience under varying sequence lengths. We introduce a teacher model that encapsulates the global sequence knowledge to guide a student model with adaptive temporal input lengths. Specifically, teacher shapes the student's feature space via intermediate embedding, prototypes and soft label perspectives to realize knowledge transfer, while dynamically aggregating student model to mitigate knowledge forgetting. Finally, we introduce full-sequence reconstruction as an auxiliary task to further enhance the quality of representations across inputs of varying temporal lengths.

Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization alleviates this issue by estimating gradients through forward passes and Gaussian sampling, avoiding the need for backpropagation. However, conventional ZO methods suffer from high variance in gradient estimation due to their reliance on random perturbations, leading to slow convergence and suboptimal performance. We propose a simple plug-and-play method that incorporates prior-informed perturbations to refine gradient estimation. Our method dynamically computes a guiding vector from Gaussian samples, which directs perturbations toward more informative directions, significantly accelerating convergence compared to standard ZO approaches. We further investigate a greedy perturbation strategy to explore the impact of prior knowledge on gradient estimation. Theoretically, we prove that our gradient estimator achieves stronger alignment with the true gradient direction, enhancing optimization efficiency. Extensive experiments across LLMs of varying scales and architectures demonstrate that our proposed method could seamlessly integrate into existing optimization methods, delivering faster convergence and superior performance.

While recent sparse lane detectors have surpassed dense BEV approaches, they completely disregard valuable lane-specific priors.

This paper introduces the DSC2025 ViHallu Challenge, the first large-scale shared task for detecting hallucinations in Vietnamese LLMs. We present the ViHallu dataset, comprising 10,000 annotated triplets of (context, prompt, response) samples systematically partitioned into three hallucination categories: no hallucination, intrinsic, and extrinsic hallucinations.

Furthermore, these translated camera views are used to derive a synthetic epipolar depth prior through triangulation, which serves as a self-supervised depth regularizer. These geometric constraints facilitate the spatial optimization of 3D Gaussians and preserve scene structure in underwater environments. We also propose a depth-aware alpha adjustment that modulates the opacity of 3D Gaussians during early training based on their $z$-component and viewing direction, deterring the formation of medium-induced primitives. With our contributions, 3D Gaussians are disentangled from the scattering medium, enabling robust representation of object geometry and significantly reducing floating artifacts in reconstructed underwater scenes.

This paper presents a multimodal diagnostic framework that harmonizes time-series representations with pretrained language model embedding spaces. Our approach contributes three technical advances: (1) a semantic compression technique that distills temporal segments into single-token abstractions while preserving pattern semantics, (2) an alignment encoder utilizing gated cross-attention to project time-series features into language model latent space, and (3) a retrieval-augmented diagnostic pipeline that synthesizes aligned embeddings with historical incident knowledge for expert-level failure attribution.

Together, they provide an end-to-end pipeline for high-precision multimodal search by mapping diverse modalities, including text, images, document images, and video, into a unified representation space. The Qwen3-VL-Embedding model employs a multi-stage training paradigm, progressing from large-scale contrastive pre-training to reranking model distillation, to generate semantically rich high-dimensional vectors. It supports Matryoshka Representation Learning, enabling flexible embedding dimensions, and handles inputs up to 32k tokens. Complementing this, Qwen3-VL-Reranker performs fine-grained relevance estimation for query-document pairs using a cross-encoder architecture with cross-attention mechanisms. Both model series inherit the multilingual capabilities of Qwen3-VL, supporting more than 30 languages, and are released in $\\textbf{2B}$ and $\\textbf{8B}$ parameter sizes to accommodate diverse deployment requirements. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the Qwen3-VL-Embedding series achieves state-of-the-art results across diverse multimodal embedding evaluation benchmarks. Specifically, Qwen3-VL-Embedding-8B attains an overall score of $\\textbf{77.8}$ on MMEB-V2, ranking first among all models (as of January 8, 2025). This report presents the architecture, training methodology, and practical capabilities of the series, demonstrating their effectiveness on various multimodal retrieval tasks, including image-text retrieval, visual question answering, and video-text matching."}

Using PolyFit, the surfaces can be efficiently deformed by updating a compact set of jet coefficients rather than optimizing per-vertex degrees of freedom for many downstream tasks in computer vision and graphics. We demonstrate the capabilities of our proposed methodologies with two applications: 1) Shape-from-template (SfT): where the goal is to deform the input 3D template of an object as seen in image/video. Using PolyFit, we adopt test-time optimization that delivers competitive accuracy while being markedly faster than offline physics-based solvers, and outperforms recent physics-guided neural simulators in accuracy at modest additional runtime. 2) Garment draping.

We propose ThinkDrive, a CoT guided progressive RL fine-tuning framework for autonomous driving that synergizes explicit reasoning with difficulty-aware adaptive policy optimization. Our method employs a two-stage training strategy. First, we perform SFT using CoT explanations. Then, we apply progressive RL with a difficulty-aware adaptive policy optimizer that dynamically adjusts learning intensity based on sample complexity. We evaluate our approach on a public dataset. The results show that ThinkDrive outperforms strong RL baselines by 1.45%, 1.95%, and 1.01% on exam, easy-exam, and accuracy, respectively.

In this paper, we use a unique, large-scale dataset of more than one million self-annotated posts and a pre-registered research design to investigate gender biases in emotion detection across 414 combinations of models and emotion-related classes. We find that across different types of automatic classifiers and various underlying emotions, error rates are consistently higher for texts authored by men compared to those authored by women. We quantify how this bias could affect results in downstream applications and show that current machine learning tools, including large language models, should be applied with caution when the gender composition of a sample is not known or variable. Our findings demonstrate that sentiment analysis is not yet a solved problem, especially in ensuring equitable model behaviour across demographic groups."}

To effectively scale to long-horizon scenarios, a key capability for such agents is a memory mechanism that can retain, organize, and retrieve past experiences to support downstream decision-making. However, most existing approaches organize and store memories in a flat manner and rely on simple similarity-based retrieval techniques. Even when structured memory is introduced, existing methods often struggle to explicitly capture the logical relationships among experiences or memory units. Moreover, memory access is largely detached from the constructed structure and still depends on shallow semantic retrieval, preventing agents from reasoning logically over long-horizon dependencies. In this work, we propose CompassMem, an event-centric memory framework inspired by Event Segmentation Theory. CompassMem organizes memory as an Event Graph by incrementally segmenting experiences into events and linking them through explicit logical relations. This graph serves as a logic map, enabling agents to perform structured and goal-directed navigation over memory beyond superficial retrieval, progressively gathering valuable memories to support long-horizon reasoning. Experiments on LoCoMo and NarrativeQA demonstrate that CompassMem consistently improves both retrieval and reasoning performance across multiple backbone models."}

Domain-specific datasets of harmful prompts remain scarce and still largely rely on manual construction; public datasets mainly focus on explicit harmful prompts, which modern LLM defenses can often detect and refuse. In contrast, implicit harmful prompts-expressed through indirect domain knowledge-are harder to detect and better reflect real-world threats. We identify two challenges: transforming domain knowledge into actionable constraints and increasing the implicitness of generated harmful prompts. To address them, we propose an end-to-end framework that first performs knowledge-graph-guided harmful prompt generation to systematically produce domain-relevant prompts, and then applies dual-path obfuscation rewriting to convert explicit harmful prompts into implicit variants via direct and context-enhanced rewriting. This framework yields high-quality datasets combining strong domain relevance with implicitness, enabling more realistic red-teaming and advancing LLM safety research.

While MADKE introduces external evidence to mitigate this, its one-time retrieval mechanism limits adaptability to new arguments or emerging information during the debate. To address these limitations, We propose Tool-MAD, a multi-agent debate framework that enhances factual verification by assigning each agent a distinct external tool, such as a search API or RAG module. Tool-MAD introduces three key innovations: (1) a multi-agent debate framework where agents leverage heterogeneous external tools, encouraging diverse perspectives, (2) an adaptive query formulation mechanism that iteratively refines evidence retrieval based on the flow of the debate, and (3) the integration of Faithfulness and Answer Relevance scores into the final decision process, allowing the Judge agent to quantitatively assess the coherence and question alignment of each response and effectively detect hallucinations. Experimental results on four fact verification benchmarks demonstrate that Tool-MAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MAD frameworks, achieving up to 5.5% accuracy improvement. Furthermore, in medically specialized domains, Tool-MAD exhibits strong robustness and adaptability across various tool configurations and domain conditions, confirming its potential for broader real-world fact-checking applications."}

We propose projective conditioning, which replaces raw camera parameters with a target-view projective cue that provides a stable 2D input. This reframes the task from a brittle geometric regression problem in ray space to a well-conditioned target-view image-to-image translation problem.

These systems are compounded by specialized agents, which collaborate through explicit communication, but incur substantial computational overhead. A natural question arises: can we achieve similar modularity benefits with a single agent that selects from a library of skills? We explore this question by viewing skills as internalized agent behaviors. From this perspective, a multi-agent system can be compiled into an equivalent single-agent system, trading inter-agent communication for skill selection. Our preliminary experiments suggest this approach can substantially reduce token usage and latency while maintaining competitive accuracy on reasoning benchmarks. However, this efficiency raises a deeper question that has received little attention: how does skill selection scale as libraries grow?\n  Drawing on principles from cognitive science, we propose that LLM skill selection exhibits bounded capacity analogous to human decision-making. We investigate the scaling behavior of skill selection and observe a striking pattern. Rather than degrading gradually, selection accuracy remains stable up to a critical library size, then drops sharply, indicating a phase transition reminiscent of capacity limits in human cognition. Furthermore, we find evidence that semantic confusability among similar skills, rather than library size alone, plays a central role in this degradation. This perspective suggests that hierarchical organization, which has long helped humans manage complex choices, may similarly benefit AI systems. Our initial results with hierarchical routing support this hypothesis. This work opens new questions about the fundamental limits of semantic-based skill selection in LLMs and offers a cognitive-grounded framework and practical guidelines for designing scalable skill-based agents."}

Agentic Reinforcement Learning has recently drawn significant research attention as a critical post-training paradigm to further refine these capabilities. In this paper, we present AT$^2$PO (Agentic Turn-based Policy Optimization via Tree Search), a unified framework for multi-turn agentic RL that addresses three core challenges: limited exploration diversity, sparse credit assignment, and misaligned policy optimization. AT$^2$PO introduces a turn-level tree structure that jointly enables Entropy-Guided Tree Expansion for strategic exploration and Turn-wise Credit Assignment for fine-grained reward propagation from sparse outcomes. Complementing this, we propose Agentic Turn-based Policy Optimization, a turn-level learning objective that aligns policy updates with the natural decision granularity of agentic interactions. ATPO is orthogonal to tree search and can be readily integrated into any multi-turn RL pipeline. Experiments across seven benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements over the state-of-the-art baseline by up to 1.84 percentage points in average, with ablation studies validating the effectiveness of each component.

We theoretically prove a structural correspondence between learned linear judges and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, demonstrating they rely on the same underlying logit primitives. Guided by this, we propose a simple, training-free verification mechanism based on KL divergence.

To bridge this gap, we introduce VerseCrafter, a 4D-aware video world model that enables explicit and coherent control over both camera and object dynamics within a unified 4D geometric world state. Our approach is centered on a novel 4D Geometric Control representation, which encodes the world state through a static background point cloud and per-object 3D Gaussian trajectories. This representation captures not only an object's path but also its probabilistic 3D occupancy over time, offering a flexible, category-agnostic alternative to rigid bounding boxes or parametric models. These 4D controls are rendered into conditioning signals for a pretrained video diffusion model, enabling the generation of high-fidelity, view-consistent videos that precisely adhere to the specified dynamics. Unfortunately, another major challenge lies in the scarcity of large-scale training data with explicit 4D annotations. We address this by developing an automatic data engine that extracts the required 4D controls from in-the-wild videos, allowing us to train our model on a massive and diverse dataset."}

To address this gap, we introduce scientific instruction following: the capability to solve problems while strictly adhering to the constraints that establish scientific validity. Specifically, we introduce SciIF, a multi-discipline benchmark that evaluates this capability by pairing university-level problems with a fixed catalog of constraints across three pillars: scientific conditions (e.g., boundary checks and assumptions), semantic stability (e.g., unit and symbol conventions), and specific processes(e.g., required numerical methods). Uniquely, SciIF emphasizes auditability, requiring models to provide explicit evidence of constraint satisfaction rather than implicit compliance. By measuring both solution correctness and multi-constraint adherence, SciIF enables finegrained diagnosis of compositional reasoning failures, ensuring that LLMs can function as reliable agents within the strict logical frameworks of science."}

By embedding adversarial instructions into the results of tool calls, attackers can hijack the agent's decision-making process to execute unauthorized actions. This vulnerability poses a significant risk as agents gain more direct control over physical environments. Existing defense mechanisms against Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI) generally fall into two categories. The first involves training dedicated detection models; however, this approach entails high computational overhead for both training and inference, and requires frequent updates to keep pace with evolving attack vectors. Alternatively, prompt-based methods leverage the inherent capabilities of LLMs to detect or ignore malicious instructions via prompt engineering. Despite their flexibility, most current prompt-based defenses suffer from high Attack Success Rates (ASR), demonstrating limited robustness against sophisticated injection attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel method that provides LLMs with precise data via tool result parsing while effectively filtering out injected malicious code.

Our method leverages a low-resolution drafter paired with learned up-samplers to propose candidate image tokens, which are then verified in parallel by a high-resolution target model.

However, their performance mainly stems from thinking, a long Chain of Thought (CoT), which significantly increase computational overhead. To address this overthinking problem, existing work focuses on using reinforcement learning (RL) to train hybrid reasoning models that automatically decide whether to engage in thinking or not based on the complexity of the query. Unfortunately, using RL will suffer the the reward hacking problem, e.g., the model engages in thinking but is judged as not doing so, resulting in incorrect rewards. To mitigate this problem, existing works either employ supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which incurs high computational costs, or enforce uniform token limits on non-thinking responses, which yields limited mitigation of the problem. In this paper, we propose Thinking-Based Non-Thinking (TNT). It does not employ SFT, and sets different maximum token usage for responses not using thinking across various queries by leveraging information from the solution component of the responses using thinking. Experiments on five mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that TNT reduces token usage by around 50% compared to DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B/7B and DeepScaleR-1.5B, while significantly improving accuracy. In fact, TNT achieves the optimal trade-off between accuracy and efficiency among all tested methods.

To address these gaps, we introduce RAAR, the first retrieval-augmented agentic reasoning framework for cross-domain misinformation detection. To enable cross-domain transfer beyond same-distribution assumptions, RAAR retrieves multi-perspective source-domain evidence aligned with each target sample's semantics, sentiment, and writing style.

We propose Chain-of-View (CoV) prompting, a training-free, test-time reasoning framework that transforms a VLM into an active viewpoint reasoner through a coarse-to-fine exploration process. CoV first employs a View Selection agent to filter redundant frames and identify question-aligned anchor views.

Rather than sampling tokens, the model evolves continuous token representations through a deterministic dynamical process, committing to a discrete token only when the representation has sufficiently converged. Discrete text is recovered via hard decoding, while uncertainty is maintained and resolved in the continuous space.\n  We show that this maturation process alone is sufficient to produce coherent and diverse text using deterministic decoding (argmax), without reliance on token-level sampling, diffusion-style denoising, or auxiliary stabilization mechanisms. Additional perturbations, such as stochastic dynamics or history smoothing, can be incorporated naturally but are not required for the model to function.\n  To our knowledge, this is the first autoregressive language model that generates text by evolving continuous token representations to convergence prior to discretization, enabling stable generation without token-level sampling."}

However, its necessity and advantages over direct answering remain underexplored. In this paper, we first demonstrate that for RL-trained video models, direct answering often matches or even surpasses CoT performance, despite CoT producing step-by-step analyses at a higher computational cost. Motivated by this, we propose VideoAuto-R1, a video understanding framework that adopts a reason-when-necessary strategy. During training, our approach follows a Thinking Once, Answering Twice paradigm: the model first generates an initial answer, then performs reasoning, and finally outputs a reviewed answer. Both answers are supervised via verifiable rewards. During inference, the model uses the confidence score of the initial answer to determine whether to proceed with reasoning. Across video QA and grounding benchmarks, VideoAuto-R1 achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with significantly improved efficiency, reducing the average response length by ~3.3x, e.g., from 149 to just 44 tokens. Moreover, we observe a low rate of thinking-mode activation on perception-oriented tasks, but a higher rate on reasoning-intensive tasks. This suggests that explicit language-based reasoning is generally beneficial but not always necessary."}

We propose a Dynamic Rank LoRA framework named DR-LoRA, which dynamically grows expert LoRA ranks during fine-tuning based on task-specific demands. DR-LoRA employs an Expert Saliency Scoring mechanism that integrates expert routing frequency and LoRA rank importance to quantify each expert's demand for additional capacity. Experts with higher saliency scores are prioritized for rank expansion, enabling the automatic formation of a heterogeneous rank distribution tailored to the target task.

To address these gaps, we introduce MisSpans, the first multi-domain, human-annotated benchmark for span-level misinformation detection and analysis, consisting of paired real and fake news stories. MisSpans defines three complementary tasks: MisSpansIdentity for pinpointing false spans within sentences, MisSpansType for categorising false spans by misinformation type, and MisSpansExplanation for providing rationales grounded in identified spans. Together, these tasks enable fine-grained localisation, nuanced characterisation beyond true/false and actionable explanations. Expert annotators were guided by standardised guidelines and consistency checks, leading to high inter-annotator agreement. We evaluate 15 representative LLMs, including reasoning-enhanced and non-reasoning variants, under zero-shot and one-shot settings.

We developed AgentCompress to tackle this problem head-on. The core idea came from a simple observation during our own work: writing a novel hypothesis clearly demands more from the model than reformatting a bibliography. Why should both tasks run at full precision? Our system uses a small neural network to gauge how hard each incoming task will be, based only on its opening words, then routes it to a suitably compressed model variant. The decision happens in under a millisecond. Testing across 500 research workflows in four scientific fields, we cut compute costs by 68.3% while keeping 96.2% of the original success rate.

We address this inefficiency by proposing OI-MAS framework, a novel multi-agent framework that implements an adaptive model-selection policy across a heterogeneous pool of multi-scale LLMs. Specifically, OI-MAS introduces a state-dependent routing mechanism that dynamically selects agent roles and model scales throughout the reasoning process. In addition, we introduce a confidence-aware mechanism that selects appropriate model scales conditioned on task complexity, thus reducing unnecessary reliance on large-scale models.

To bridge this gap, we propose a novel RAG framework: ToPG (Traversal over Proposition Graphs). ToPG models its knowledge base as a heterogeneous graph of propositions, entities, and passages, effectively combining the granular fact density of propositions with graph connectivity. We leverage this structure using iterative Suggestion-Selection cycles, where the Suggestion phase enables a query-aware traversal of the graph, and the Selection phase provides LLM feedback to prune irrelevant propositions and seed the next iteration. Evaluated on three distinct QA tasks (Simple, Complex, and Abstract QA), ToPG demonstrates strong performance across both accuracy- and quality-based metrics. Overall, ToPG shows that query-aware graph traversal combined with factual granularity is a critical component for efficient structured RAG systems.

At low object counts, models often correct the overestimation, but as the number of objects increases, they increasingly conform to the prompt regardless of the discrepancy. Through mechanistic analysis of three VLMs, we identify a small set of attention heads whose ablation substantially reduces prompt-induced hallucinations (PIH) by at least 40% without additional training. Across models, PIH-heads mediate prompt copying in model-specific ways. We characterize these differences and show that PIH ablation increases correction toward visual evidence. Our findings offer insights into the internal mechanisms driving prompt-induced hallucinations, revealing model-specific differences in how these behaviors are implemented."}

To address this, we introduce EvolSQL, a structure-aware data synthesis framework that evolves SQL queries from seed data into richer and more semantically diverse forms. EvolSQL starts with an exploratory Query-SQL expansion to broaden question diversity and improve schema coverage, and then applies an adaptive directional evolution strategy using six atomic transformation operators derived from the SQL Abstract Syntax Tree to progressively increase query complexity across relational, predicate, aggregation, and nesting dimensions. An execution-grounded SQL refinement module and schema-aware deduplication further ensure the creation of high-quality, structurally diverse mapping pairs.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer inferential capabilities, they often depend on retrieval-augmented contexts that lack structural depth. Traditional Knowledge Graphs (KGs) attempt to bridge this gap, yet their pairwise constraints fail to capture the irreducible higher-order interactions that govern emergent physical behavior. To address this, we introduce a methodology for constructing hypergraph-based knowledge representations that faithfully encode multi-entity relationships. Applied to a corpus of ~1,100 manuscripts on biocomposite scaffolds, our framework constructs a global hypergraph of 161,172 nodes and 320,201 hyperedges, revealing a scale-free topology (power law exponent ~1.23) organized around highly connected conceptual hubs. This representation prevents the combinatorial explosion typical of pairwise expansions and explicitly preserves the co-occurrence context of scientific formulations. We further demonstrate that equipping agentic systems with hypergraph traversal tools, specifically using node-intersection constraints, enables them to bridge semantically distant concepts. By exploiting these higher-order pathways, the system successfully generates grounded mechanistic hypotheses for novel composite materials, such as linking cerium oxide to PCL scaffolds via chitosan intermediates. This work establishes a \"teacherless\" agentic reasoning system where hypergraph topology acts as a verifiable guardrail, accelerating scientific discovery by uncovering relationships obscured by traditional graph methods."}

Acquiring new data is costly and ethically constrained, motivating generative data augmentation. Current generative methods are often based on latent diffusion models, which operate in learned low dimensional latent spaces to address the memory demands of volumetric MRI data.

On the other hand, replanning other agents may lead to a cascade of changes and delays. We show how to efficiently replan by tracking and using the temporal flexibility of other agents while avoiding cascading delays. This flexibility is the maximum delay an agent can take without changing the order of or further delaying more agents. Our algorithm, FlexSIPP, precomputes all possible plans for the delayed agent, also returning the changes for the other agents, for any single-agent delay within the given scenario.

We decouple the sources of this bias into two dimensions: Internal Corpus Bias, stemming from statistical correlations in pretraining, and External Instruction Bias, arising from the alignment-induced tendency toward sycophancy. To quantify this effect, we introduce V-FAT (Visual Fidelity Against Text-bias), a diagnostic benchmark comprising 4,026 VQA instances across six semantic domains. V-FAT employs a Three-Level Evaluation Framework that systematically increases the conflict between visual evidence and textual information: (L1) internal bias from atypical images, (L2) external bias from misleading instructions, and (L3) synergistic bias where both coincide. We introduce the Visual Robustness Score (VRS), a metric designed to penalize \"lucky\" linguistic guesses and reward true visual fidelity. Our evaluation of 12 frontier MLLMs reveals that while models excel in existing benchmarks, they experience significant visual collapse under high linguistic dominance."}

However, due to hardware and physical setup constraints, collecting large-scale real-world manipulation data remains difficult to scale across diverse environments. Recent work uses text-prompt conditioned image diffusion models to augment manipulation data by altering the backgrounds and tabletop objects in the visual observations. However, these approaches often overlook the practical need for multi-view and temporally coherent observations required by state-of-the-art policy models. Further, text prompts alone cannot reliably specify the scene setup. To provide the diffusion model with explicit visual guidance, we introduce visual identity prompting, which supplies exemplar images as conditioning inputs to guide the generation of the desired scene setup. To this end, we also build a scalable pipeline to curate a visual identity pool from large robotics datasets. Using our augmented manipulation data to train downstream vision-language-action and visuomotor policy models yields consistent performance gains in both simulation and real-robot settings."}

This greatly limits the real applications of REx (RES/REC/REG). This paper introduces three new benchmarks called Generalized Referring Expression Segmentation (GRES), Comprehension (GREC), and Generation (GREG), collectively denoted as GREx, which extend the classic REx to allow expressions to identify an arbitrary number of objects. We construct the first large-scale GREx dataset gRefCOCO that contains multi-target, no-target, and single-target expressions and their corresponding images with labeled targets. GREx and gRefCOCO are designed to be backward-compatible with REx, facilitating extensive experiments to study the performance gap of the existing REx methods on GREx tasks. One of the challenges of GRES/GREC is complex relationship modeling, for which we propose a baseline ReLA that adaptively divides the image into regions with sub-instance clues and explicitly models the region-region and region-language dependencies. The proposed ReLA achieves the state-of-the-art results on the both GRES and GREC tasks. The proposed gRefCOCO dataset and method are available at https://henghuiding.github.io/GREx."}

To enable this, we present ReFInE (Relation-aware Fine-grained Interpretability & Evidence), a dataset featuring expert verified annotations that distinguish between Quotation, Compression, and Inference.

We first introduce Pixel-Perfect Depth (PPD), a monocular depth foundation model built upon pixel-space diffusion transformers (DiT). To address the high computational complexity associated with pixel-space diffusion, we propose two key designs: 1) Semantics-Prompted DiT, which incorporates semantic representations from vision foundation models to prompt the diffusion process, preserving global semantics while enhancing fine-grained visual details; and 2) Cascade DiT architecture that progressively increases the number of image tokens, improving both efficiency and accuracy. To further extend PPD to video (PPVD), we introduce a new Semantics-Consistent DiT, which extracts temporally consistent semantics from a multi-view geometry foundation model. We then perform reference-guided token propagation within the DiT to maintain temporal coherence with minimal computational and memory overhead. Our models achieve the best performance among all generative monocular and video depth estimation models and produce significantly cleaner point clouds than all other models."}

Further advancing this potential, we explored authentic dialogues between students and GenAI assistant integrated into LAD during a 10-week semester. The analysis focused on questions students with different SRL levels posed, the relevance and quality of the assistant's answers, and how students perceived the assistant's role in their learning.

Findings further extend that GenAI interventions can be especially valuable for low SRL students, offering scaffolding that supports engagement with feedback and narrows gaps with their higher SRL peers.

The formulation leads to interpretable and reusable preference descriptions, while naturally supporting continual evolution as new interactions are observed.

Meanwhile, novel-view synthesis has seen major advances with Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), where models learn a compact representation from 2D images to render 3D scenes, albeit at the cost of larger models and intensive training. In this work, we extend the approach of QVFs by introducing QNeRF, the first hybrid quantum-classical model designed for novel-view synthesis from 2D images. QNeRF leverages parameterised quantum circuits to encode spatial and view-dependent information via quantum superposition and entanglement, resulting in more compact models compared to the classical counterpart. We present two architectural variants. Full QNeRF maximally exploits all quantum amplitudes to enhance representational capabilities. In contrast, Dual-Branch QNeRF introduces a task-informed inductive bias by branching spatial and view-dependent quantum state preparations, drastically reducing the complexity of this operation and ensuring scalability and potential hardware compatibility. Our experiments demonstrate that -- when trained on images of moderate resolution -- QNeRF matches or outperforms classical NeRF baselines while using less than half the number of parameters. These results suggest that quantum machine learning can serve as a competitive alternative for continuous signal representation in mid-level tasks in computer vision, such as 3D representation learning from 2D observations."}

Specifically, we surprisingly find that incorporating negative trajectories into SFT yields substantial OOD generalization gains over positive-only training, as these trajectories often retain valid intermediate reasoning despite incorrect final answers. To understand this effect in depth, we systematically analyze data, training dynamics, and inference behavior, identifying 22 recurring patterns in negative chains that serve a dual role: they moderate loss descent to mitigate overfitting during training and boost policy entropy by 35.67% during inference to facilitate exploration. Motivated by these observations, we further propose Gain-based LOss Weighting (GLOW), an adaptive, sample-aware scheme that exploits such distinctive training dynamics by rescaling per-sample loss based on inter-epoch progress. Empirically, GLOW efficiently leverages unfiltered trajectories, yielding a 5.51% OOD gain over positive-only SFT on Qwen2.5-7B and boosting MMLU from 72.82% to 76.47% as an RL initialization."}

In this paper, we introduce ConMax (Confidence-Maximizing Compression), a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to automatically compress reasoning traces while preserving essential reasoning patterns. ConMax formulates compression as a reward-driven optimization problem, training a policy to prune redundancy by maximizing a weighted combination of answer confidence for predictive fidelity and thinking confidence for reasoning validity through a frozen auxiliary LRM. Extensive experiments across five reasoning datasets demonstrate that ConMax achieves a superior efficiency-performance trade-off.

As large language models (LLMs) are applied across various fields, some researchers have begun exploring their application for detecting self-destructive behaviors. Motivated by this, we investigate self-destructive behavior detection within subcultures using current LLM-based methods. However, these methods have two main challenges: (1) Knowledge Lag: Subcultural slang evolves rapidly, faster than LLMs' training cycles; and (2) Semantic Misalignment: it is challenging to grasp the specific and nuanced expressions unique to subcultures. To address these issues, we proposed Subcultural Alignment Solver (SAS), a multi-agent framework that incorporates automatic retrieval and subculture alignment, significantly enhancing the performance of LLMs in detecting self-destructive behavior. Our experimental results show that SAS outperforms the current advanced multi-agent framework OWL. Notably, it competes well with fine-tuned LLMs. We hope that SAS will advance the field of self-destructive behavior detection in subcultural contexts and serve as a valuable resource for future researchers."}

To address this gap, we focus on the front-end development task and curate FronTalk, a collection of 100 multi-turn dialogues derived from real-world websites across diverse domains such as news, finance, and art. Each turn features both a textual instruction and an equivalent visual instruction, each representing the same user intent. To comprehensively evaluate model performance, we propose a novel agent-based evaluation framework leveraging a web agent to simulate users and explore the website, and thus measuring both functional correctness and user experience. Evaluation of 20 models reveals two key challenges that are under-explored systematically in the literature: (1) a significant forgetting issue where models overwrite previously implemented features, resulting in task failures, and (2) a persistent challenge in interpreting visual feedback, especially for open-source vision-language models (VLMs). We propose a strong baseline to tackle the forgetting issue with AceCoder, a method that critiques the implementation of every past instruction using an autonomous web agent. This approach significantly reduces forgetting to nearly zero and improves the performance by up to 9.3% (56.0% to 65.3%).

These findings expose fundamental limitations of problem-centric reinforcement learning and highlight the necessity of an algorithm-centric training paradigm for robust algorithmic reasoning."}

A Cognitive Perspective on Reasoning Distillation in Large Language Models", "comment": "7 pages, 7 figures", "summary": "Recent Large Reasoning Models trained via reinforcement learning exhibit a \"natural\" alignment with human cognitive costs. However, we show that the prevailing paradigm of reasoning distillation -- training student models to mimic these traces via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) -- fails to transmit this cognitive structure. Testing the \"Hán Dān Xué Bù\" (Superficial Mimicry) hypothesis across 14 models, we find that distillation induces a \"Functional Alignment Collapse\": while teacher models mirror human difficulty scaling ($\\bar{r}=0.64$), distilled students significantly degrade this alignment ($\\bar{r}=0.34$), often underperforming their own pre-distillation baselines (\"Negative Transfer\"). Our analysis suggests that SFT induces a \"Cargo Cult\" effect, where students ritualistically replicate the linguistic form of reasoning (verbosity) without internalizing the teacher's dynamic resource allocation policy. Consequently, reasoning distillation decouples computational cost from cognitive demand, revealing that human-like cognition is an emergent property of active reinforcement, not passive imitation."}

Rendering efficiently on such hardware therefore requires distributing both data and computation, keeping ray traversal mostly local, and structuring communication into predictable routes.\n  We present a fully in-SRAM, distributed renderer for the \\emph{Radiant Foam} Voronoi-cell volumetric representation on the Graphcore Mk2 IPU, a many-core accelerator with tile-local SRAM and explicit inter-tile communication. Our system shards the scene across tiles and forwards rays between shards through a hierarchical routing overlay, enabling ray marching entirely from on-chip SRAM with predictable communication.

In this paper, we introduce a fully convolutional, conditionally parameterized U-Net surrogate designed to extrapolate far beyond its training data in both space and time. The architecture integrates convolutional self-attention, physically informed padding, and a flood-fill corrector method to maintain accuracy under extreme extrapolation, while conditioning on simulation parameters allows for flexible time-step skipping and adaptation to varying alloy compositions. To remove the need for costly solver-based initialization, we couple the surrogate with a conditional diffusion model that generates synthetic, physically consistent initial conditions. We train our surrogate on simulations generated over small domain sizes and short time spans, but, by taking advantage of the convolutional nature of U-Nets, we are able to run and extrapolate surrogate simulations for longer time horizons than what would be achievable with classic numerical solvers. Across multiple alloy compositions, the framework is able to reproduce the LMD physics accurately. It predicts key quantities of interest and spatial statistics with relative errors typically below 5% in the training regime and under 15% during large-scale, long time-horizon extrapolations. Our framework can also deliver speed-ups of up to 36,000 times, bringing the time to run weeks-long simulations down to a few seconds. This work is a first stepping stone towards high-fidelity extrapolation in both space and time of phase-field simulation for LMD."}

OptiSet adopts an \"Expand-then-Refine\" paradigm: it first expands a query into multiple perspectives to enable a diverse candidate pool and then refines the candidate pool via re-selection to form a compact evidence set. We then devise a self-synthesis strategy without strong LLM supervision to derive preference labels from the set conditional utility changes of the generator, thereby identifying complementary and redundant evidence.

In this work, we propose \\emph{compositional steering tokens} for multi-behavior steering. We first embed individual behaviors, expressed as natural language instructions, into dedicated tokens via self-distillation. Contrary to most prior work, which operates in the activation space, our behavior steers live in the space of input tokens, enabling more effective zero-shot composition. We then train a dedicated \\textit{composition token} on pairs of behaviors and show that it successfully captures the notion of composition: it generalizes well to \\textit{unseen} compositions, including those with unseen behaviors as well as those with an unseen \\textit{number} of behaviors. Our experiments across different LLM architectures show that steering tokens lead to superior multi-behavior control compared to competing approaches (instructions, activation steering, and LoRA merging). Moreover, we show that steering tokens complement natural language instructions, with their combination resulting in further gains."}

However, with the paradigm shift towards the Warmup-Stable-Decay (WSD) learning rate scheduler, we observe that the original theoretical framework and its underlying mechanisms fail to align with new pre-training dynamics. To bridge this gap between theory and practice, this paper derives a revised E(S) relationship tailored for WSD scheduler, characterizing the trade-off between training data consumption E and steps S during pre-training. Our theoretical analysis reveals two fundamental properties of WSD-based pre-training: 1) B_min, the minimum batch size threshold required to achieve a target loss, and 2) B_opt, the optimal batch size that maximizes data efficiency by minimizing total tokens. Building upon these properties, we propose a dynamic Batch Size Scheduler. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our revised formula precisely captures the dynamics of large-scale pre-training, and the resulting scheduling strategy significantly enhances both training efficiency and final model quality."}

We propose SemPA, a novel approach that boosts the sentence representations while preserving the generative ability of LLMs via semantic preference alignment. We leverage sentence-level Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to efficiently optimize LLMs on a paraphrase generation task, where the model learns to discriminate semantically equivalent sentences while preserving inherent generative capacity. Theoretically, we establish a formal connection between DPO and contrastive learning under the Plackett-Luce model framework.

However, there is growing concern that these models rely excessively on linguistic shortcuts rather than genuine visual grounding, a phenomenon we term Text Bias. In this paper, we investigate the fundamental tension between visual perception and linguistic priors. We decouple the sources of this bias into two dimensions: Internal Corpus Bias, stemming from statistical correlations in pretraining, and External Instruction Bias, arising from the alignment-induced tendency toward sycophancy. To quantify this effect, we introduce V-FAT (Visual Fidelity Against Text-bias), a diagnostic benchmark comprising 4,026 VQA instances across six semantic domains. V-FAT employs a Three-Level Evaluation Framework that systematically increases the conflict between visual evidence and textual information: (L1) internal bias from atypical images, (L2) external bias from misleading instructions, and (L3) synergistic bias where both coincide. We introduce the Visual Robustness Score (VRS), a metric designed to penalize \"lucky\" linguistic guesses and reward true visual fidelity. Our evaluation of 12 frontier MLLMs reveals that while models excel in existing benchmarks, they experience significant visual collapse under high linguistic dominance."}

Within the Fitting Paradigm, we innovatively introduce a Scaling Law for search factor, effectively reducing the search complexity from O(n^3) to O(n*C_D*C_η) via predictive modeling. Within the Transfer Paradigm, we extend the principles of $μ$Transfer to the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, broadening its applicability to encompass model depth, weight decay, and token horizons. By pushing the boundaries of existing hyperparameter research in terms of scale, we conduct a comprehensive comparison between these two paradigms. Our empirical results challenge the scalability of the widely adopted $μ$ Transfer in large-scale pre-training scenarios. Furthermore, we provide a rigorous analysis through the dual lenses of training stability and feature learning to elucidate the underlying reasons why module-wise parameter tuning underperforms in large-scale settings.

When using a \"jailbroken\" GPT-4o variant with guardrails removed, the AI was as effective at increasing conspiracy belief as decreasing it. Concerningly, the bunking AI was rated more positively, and increased trust in AI, more than the debunking AI. Surprisingly, we found that using standard GPT-4o produced very similar effects, such that the guardrails imposed by OpenAI did little to revent the LLM from promoting conspiracy beliefs. Encouragingly, however, a corrective conversation reversed these newly induced conspiracy beliefs, and simply prompting GPT-4o to only use accurate information dramatically reduced its ability to increase conspiracy beliefs. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs possess potent abilities to promote both truth and falsehood, but that potential solutions may exist to help mitigate this risk."}

While world models possess this capability, they most often require action labels, that can be complex to obtain at scale. This motivates the learning of latent action models, that can learn an action space from videos alone. Our work addresses the problem of learning latent actions world models on in-the-wild videos, expanding the scope of existing works that focus on simple robotics simulations, video games, or manipulation data. While this allows us to capture richer actions, it also introduces challenges stemming from the video diversity, such as environmental noise, or the lack of a common embodiment across videos. To address some of the challenges, we discuss properties that actions should follow as well as relevant architectural choices and evaluations. We find that continuous, but constrained, latent actions are able to capture the complexity of actions from in-the-wild videos, something that the common vector quantization does not. We for example find that changes in the environment coming from agents, such as humans entering the room, can be transferred across videos. This highlights the capability of learning actions that are specific to in-the-wild videos. In the absence of a common embodiment across videos, we are mainly able to learn latent actions that become localized in space, relative to the camera. Nonetheless, we are able to train a controller that maps known actions to latent ones, allowing us to use latent actions as a universal interface and solve planning tasks with our world model with similar performance as action-conditioned baselines. Our analyses and experiments provide a step towards scaling latent action models to the real world."}

However, existing methods still suffer from limited exploration diversity and inefficient reasoning. To address the above challenges, we propose reinforced efficient reasoning via semantically diverse explorations, i.e., ROSE, for LLMs. To encourage more diverse reasoning exploration, our method incorporates a semantic-entropy-based branching strategy and an $\\varepsilon$-exploration mechanism. The former operates on already sampled reasoning rollouts to capture semantic uncertainty and select branching points with high semantic divergence to generate new successive reasoning paths, whereas the latter stochastically initiates reasoning rollouts from the root, preventing the search process from becoming overly local. To improve efficiency, we design a length-aware segment-level advantage estimator that rewards concise and correct reasoning while penalizing unnecessarily long reasoning chains. Extensive experiments on various mathematical reasoning benchmarks with Qwen and Llama models validate the effectiveness and efficiency of ROSE.

We study how to induce privacy-first reasoning, where models reason without exposing sensitive information, using deployable interventions rather than post-hoc redaction. We introduce PII-CoT-Bench, a supervised dataset with privacy-aware CoT annotations, and a category-balanced evaluation benchmark covering realistic and adversarial leakage scenarios. Our results reveal a capability-dependent trend: state-of-the-art models benefit most from prompt-based controls, whereas weaker models require fine-tuning to achieve meaningful leakage reduction. Across models and categories, both approaches substantially reduce PII exposure with minimal degradation in utility, demonstrating that private reasoning can be achieved without sacrificing performance.

Existing collaborative approaches, such as cascading or routing, operate at a coarse granularity by offloading entire queries to LLMs, resulting in significant computational waste when the SLM is capable of handling the majority of reasoning steps. To address this, we propose RelayLLM, a novel framework for efficient reasoning via token-level collaborative decoding. Unlike routers, RelayLLM empowers the SLM to act as an active controller that dynamically invokes the LLM only for critical tokens via a special command, effectively \"relaying\" the generation process. We introduce a two-stage training framework, including warm-up and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to teach the model to balance independence with strategic help-seeking. Empirical results across six benchmarks demonstrate that RelayLLM achieves an average accuracy of 49.52%, effectively bridging the performance gap between the two models. Notably, this is achieved by invoking the LLM for only 1.07% of the total generated tokens, offering a 98.2% cost reduction compared to performance-matched random routers."}

While the development of Arabic-native LLMs is accelerating, the benchmarks for evaluating their capabilities lag behind, with most existing frameworks focusing on English. A critical and overlooked area is tool-calling, where the performance of models prompted in non-English languages like Arabic is poorly understood, especially since these models are often pretrained on predominantly English data. This paper addresses this critical gap by introducing the first dedicated benchmark for evaluating the tool-calling and agentic capabilities of LLMs in the Arabic language. Our work provides a standardized framework to measure the functional accuracy and robustness of models in Arabic agentic workflows. Our findings reveal a huge performance gap: when users interact in Arabic, tool-calling accuracy drops by an average of 5-10\\%, regardless of whether the tool descriptions themselves are in Arabic or English. By shedding light on these critical challenges, this benchmark aims to foster the development of more reliable and linguistically equitable AI agents for Arabic-speaking users."}

However, achieving strong performance across these domains with a single general-purpose model typically requires scaling to sizes that are prohibitively expensive to train and deploy. On the other hand, while smaller domain-specialized models are much more efficient, they struggle to generalize beyond their training distributions. To address this dilemma, we propose FusionRoute, a robust and effective token-level multi-LLM collaboration framework in which a lightweight router simultaneously (i) selects the most suitable expert at each decoding step and (ii) contributes a complementary logit that refines or corrects the selected expert's next-token distribution via logit addition. Unlike existing token-level collaboration methods that rely solely on fixed expert outputs, we provide a theoretical analysis showing that pure expert-only routing is fundamentally limited: unless strong global coverage assumptions hold, it cannot in general realize the optimal decoding policy. By augmenting expert selection with a trainable complementary generator, FusionRoute expands the effective policy class and enables recovery of optimal value functions under mild conditions. Empirically, across both Llama-3 and Gemma-2 families and diverse benchmarks spanning mathematical reasoning, code generation, and instruction following, FusionRoute outperforms both sequence- and token-level collaboration, model merging, and direct fine-tuning, while remaining competitive with domain experts on their respective tasks."}

To address these challenges, this paper proposes Inside Out, a framework that utilizes a globally maintained PersonaTree as the carrier of long-term user profiling. By constraining the trunk with an initial schema and updating the branches and leaves, PersonaTree enables controllable growth, achieving memory compression while preserving consistency. Moreover, we train a lightweight MemListener via reinforcement learning with process-based rewards to produce structured, executable, and interpretable {ADD, UPDATE, DELETE, NO_OP} operations, thereby supporting the dynamic evolution of the personalized tree. During response generation, PersonaTree is directly leveraged to enhance outputs in latency-sensitive scenarios; when users require more details, the agentic mode is triggered to introduce details on-demand under the constraints of the PersonaTree. Experiments show that PersonaTree outperforms full-text concatenation and various personalized memory systems in suppressing contextual noise and maintaining persona consistency. Notably, the small MemListener model achieves memory-operation decision performance comparable to, or even surpassing, powerful reasoning models such as DeepSeek-R1-0528 and Gemini-3-Pro."}

We show that an agent's reliance on memory can be modeled as an explicit and user-controllable dimension. We first introduce a behavioral metric of memory dependence to quantify the influence of past interactions on current outputs.

Collaborative inference offers a promising solution by selectively allocating work between lightweight and large models, yet a fundamental challenge remains: determining when a reasoning step requires the capacity of a large model or the efficiency of a small model. Existing routing strategies either rely on local token probabilities or post-hoc verification, introducing significant inference overhead. In this work, we propose a novel perspective on step-wise collaboration: the difficulty of a reasoning step can be inferred from its very first token. Inspired by the \"Aha Moment\" phenomenon in LRMs, we show that the entropy of the initial token serves as a strong predictor of step difficulty. Building on this insight, we introduce GlimpRouter, a training-free step-wise collaboration framework. GlimpRouter employs a lightweight model to generate only the first token of each reasoning step and routes the step to a larger model only when the initial token entropy exceeds a threshold. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces inference latency while preserving accuracy. For instance, GlimpRouter attains a substantial 10.7% improvement in accuracy while reducing inference latency by 25.9% compared to a standalone large model on AIME25. These results suggest a simple yet effective mechanism for reasoning: allocating computation based on a glimpse of thought rather than full-step evaluation."}

We developed and tested a Chrome extension, MirrorMirror, which provides real-time feedback to YouTube viewers about the peacefulness of the media they are watching. Our long term goal is for MirrorMirror to evolve into an open-source tool for content creators, journalists, researchers, platforms, and individual users to better understand the tone of their media creation and consumption and its effects on viewers.

We find the opposite: judges are consistent, but not with each other; they are consistent with themselves. Across 3,240 evaluations (9 judges x 120 unique video x pack items x 3 independent runs), inter-judge agreement is near-zero (Krippendorff's α = 0.042). On two dimensions, judges disagree more than random noise would predict (α < 0). Yet this disagreement isn't chaos; it's structured. A classifier identifies which judge produced an evaluation with 77.1% accuracy from rubric scores alone, rising to 89.9% with disposition features. Within model families, the signal is even stronger: GPT-4.1 and GPT-5.2 are distinguishable with 99.6% accuracy. We call this the reliability paradox: judges cannot agree on what constitutes quality, yet their disagreement patterns are so stable they function as fingerprints. Each judge implements a distinct, stable theory of quality: an \"evaluative disposition\" that shapes how it interprets any rubric. We characterize these dispositions along multiple axes: harshness/leniency, dimension emphasis, within-judge stability (ICC), and evidence behavior (receipt validity, semantic linkage via NLI, and shotgun index). The implication is stark: LLM judges are not interchangeable instruments measuring a shared construct. They are distinct measurement devices, each encoding its own implicit theory of quality. Averaging their scores produces a synthetic verdict that corresponds to no judge's actual values."}

To achieve this, Reinforcement learning (RL) pipelines have begun incorporating multiple rewards, each capturing a distinct preference, to guide models toward these desired behaviors. However, recent work has defaulted to apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) under multi-reward setting without examining its suitability. In this paper, we demonstrate that directly applying GRPO to normalize distinct rollout reward combinations causes them to collapse into identical advantage values, reducing the resolution of the training signal and resulting in suboptimal convergence and, in some cases, early training failure. We then introduce Group reward-Decoupled Normalization Policy Optimization (GDPO), a new policy optimization method to resolve these issues by decoupling the normalization of individual rewards, more faithfully preserving their relative differences and enabling more accurate multi-reward optimization, along with substantially improved training stability. We compare GDPO with GRPO across three tasks: tool calling, math reasoning, and coding reasoning, evaluating both correctness metrics (accuracy, bug ratio) and constraint adherence metrics (format, length). Across all settings, GDPO consistently outperforms GRPO, demonstrating its effectiveness and generalizability for multi-reward reinforcement learning optimization."}

Token-based watermarking techniques can corrupt the reasoning flow by applying pseudo-random biases, while semantic-aware approaches improve quality but introduce significant latency or require auxiliary models. This paper introduces ReasonMark, a novel watermarking framework specifically designed for reasoning-intensive LLMs. Our approach decouples generation into an undisturbed Thinking Phase and a watermarked Answering Phase. We propose a Criticality Score to identify semantically pivotal tokens from the reasoning trace, which are distilled into a Principal Semantic Vector (PSV). The PSV then guides a semantically-adaptive mechanism that modulates watermark strength based on token-PSV alignment, ensuring robustness without compromising logical integrity. Extensive experiments show ReasonMark surpasses state-of-the-art methods by reducing text Perplexity by 0.35, increasing translation BLEU score by 0.164, and raising mathematical accuracy by 0.67 points.

We focus on two types of loops, including the typical retraining setting and the incremental fine-tuning setting, which is largely underexplored.

We find that language choice can shift outcomes more strongly than changing models, reversing proposer advantages and reallocating surplus. Crucially, effects are task-contingent: Indic languages reduce stability in distributive games yet induce richer exploration in integrative settings.

However, such slow-thinking approaches often lead to overthinking, where models produce excessively verbose responses even for simple queries, resulting in test-time inefficiency and even degraded accuracy. Prior work has attempted to mitigate this issue via adaptive reasoning strategies, but these methods largely overlook a fundamental bottleneck: visual perception failures. We argue that stable reasoning critically depends on low-level visual grounding, and that reasoning errors often originate from imperfect perception rather than insufficient deliberation. To address this limitation, we propose Gated Perception-Reasoning Optimization (GPRO), a meta-reasoning controller that dynamically routes computation among three decision paths at each generation step: a lightweight fast path, a slow perception path for re-examining visual inputs, and a slow reasoning path for internal self-reflection. To learn this distinction, we derive large-scale failure attribution supervision from approximately 790k samples, using teacher models to distinguish perceptual hallucinations from reasoning errors. We then train the controller with multi-objective reinforcement learning to optimize the trade-off between task accuracy and computational cost under uncertainty. Experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate that GPRO substantially improves both accuracy and efficiency, outperforming recent slow-thinking methods while generating significantly shorter responses."}

Two persistent challenges in this context are accurate pixel-level change detection and meaningful semantic change captioning for complex forest dynamics. While large language models (LLMs) are being adapted for interactive data exploration, their integration with vision-language models (VLMs) for remote sensing image change interpretation (RSICI) remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce an LLM-driven agent for integrated forest change analysis that supports natural language querying across multiple RSICI tasks. The proposed system builds upon a multi-level change interpretation (MCI) vision-language backbone with LLM-based orchestration. To facilitate adaptation and evaluation in forest environments, we further introduce the Forest-Change dataset, which comprises bi-temporal satellite imagery, pixel-level change masks, and multi-granularity semantic change captions generated using a combination of human annotation and rule-based methods. Experimental results show that the proposed system achieves mIoU and BLEU-4 scores of 67.10% and 40.17% on the Forest-Change dataset, and 88.13% and 34.41% on LEVIR-MCI-Trees, a tree-focused subset of LEVIR-MCI benchmark for joint change detection and captioning.

Such hallucinations in agent tool selection require early detection and error handling. Unlike existing hallucination detection methods that require multiple forward passes or external validation, we present a computationally efficient framework that detects tool-calling hallucinations in real-time by leveraging LLMs' internal representations during the same forward pass used for generation.

However, existing studies remain fragmented and typically analyze individual attack vectors in isolation, leaving the cross-stage interaction and propagation of backdoor triggers poorly understood from an agent-centric perspective. To fill this gap, we propose \\textbf{BackdoorAgent}, a modular and stage-aware framework that provides a unified, agent-centric view of backdoor threats in LLM agents. BackdoorAgent structures the attack surface into three functional stages of agentic workflows, including \\textbf{planning attacks}, \\textbf{memory attacks}, and \\textbf{tool-use attacks}, and instruments agent execution to enable systematic analysis of trigger activation and propagation across different stages.

While world models possess this capability, they most often require action labels, that can be complex to obtain at scale. This motivates the learning of latent action models, that can learn an action space from videos alone. Our work addresses the problem of learning latent actions world models on in-the-wild videos, expanding the scope of existing works that focus on simple robotics simulations, video games, or manipulation data. While this allows us to capture richer actions, it also introduces challenges stemming from the video diversity, such as environmental noise, or the lack of a common embodiment across videos. To address some of the challenges, we discuss properties that actions should follow as well as relevant architectural choices and evaluations. We find that continuous, but constrained, latent actions are able to capture the complexity of actions from in-the-wild videos, something that the common vector quantization does not. We for example find that changes in the environment coming from agents, such as humans entering the room, can be transferred across videos. This highlights the capability of learning actions that are specific to in-the-wild videos. In the absence of a common embodiment across videos, we are mainly able to learn latent actions that become localized in space, relative to the camera. Nonetheless, we are able to train a controller that maps known actions to latent ones, allowing us to use latent actions as a universal interface and solve planning tasks with our world model with similar performance as action-conditioned baselines. Our analyses and experiments provide a step towards scaling latent action models to the real world."}

However, traditional RAG systems consist of three interconnected neural components - the retriever, re-ranker, and generator - whose internal reasoning processes remain opaque. This lack of transparency complicates interpretability, hinders debugging efforts, and erodes trust, especially in high-stakes domains where clear decision-making is essential. To address these challenges, we introduce the concept of Neurosymbolic RAG, which integrates symbolic reasoning using a knowledge graph with neural retrieval techniques. This new framework aims to answer two primary questions: (a) Can retrievers provide a clear and interpretable basis for document selection? (b) Can symbolic knowledge enhance the clarity of the retrieval process? We propose three methods to improve this integration. First is MAR (Knowledge Modulation Aligned Retrieval) that employs modulation networks to refine query embeddings using interpretable symbolic features, thereby making document matching more explicit. Second, KG-Path RAG enhances queries by traversing knowledge graphs to improve overall retrieval quality and interpretability. Lastly, Process Knowledge-infused RAG utilizes domain-specific tools to reorder retrieved content based on validated workflows.

This study presents a systematic audit of three state of the art models (GPT-5.1, Gemini 3 Pro, and Claude 4.5 Opus) using HausaSafety, a novel adversarial dataset grounded in West African threat scenarios (e.g., Yahoo-Yahoo fraud, Dane gun manufacturing). Employing a 2 x 4 factorial design across 1,440 evaluations, we tested the non-linear interaction between language (English vs. Hausa) and temporal framing. Our results challenge the narrative of the multilingual safety gap. Instead of a simple degradation in low-resource settings, we identified a complex interference mechanism in which safety is determined by the intersection of variables. Although the models exhibited a reverse linguistic vulnerability with Claude 4.5 Opus proving significantly safer in Hausa (45.0%) than in English (36.7%) due to uncertainty-driven refusal, they suffered catastrophic failures in temporal reasoning. We report a profound Temporal Asymmetry, where past-tense framing bypassed defenses (15.6% safe) while future-tense scenarios triggered hyper-conservative refusals (57.2% safe). The magnitude of this volatility is illustrated by a 9.2x disparity between the safest and most vulnerable configurations, proving that safety is not a fixed property but a context-dependent state. We conclude that current models rely on superficial heuristics rather than robust semantic understanding, creating Safety Pockets that leave Global South users exposed to localized harms.

To address these challenges, we propose TourPlanner, a comprehensive framework featuring multi-path reasoning and constraint-gated reinforcement learning.

Subsequently, we propose Competitive consensus Chain-of-Thought (CCoT), a multi-path reasoning paradigm that improves the ability of exploring the feasible solution space.

To scope the problem, we audit a county-level benchmark of 14,782 local information QA pairs, where factual gaps, cultural misunderstandings, geographic confusions, and temporal misalignments account for 76.7% of errors.

The missing facts often appear in the collected narratives, suggesting a direct path to closing the dominant error modes for narrative items. Beyond the protocol and pilot, we articulate key design tensions, such as representation and power, governance and control, and privacy and consent, providing concrete requirements for retrieval-first, provenance-visible, locally governed QA systems.

To effectively scale to long-horizon scenarios, a key capability for such agents is a memory mechanism that can retain, organize, and retrieve past experiences to support downstream decision-making. However, most existing approaches organize and store memories in a flat manner and rely on simple similarity-based retrieval techniques. Even when structured memory is introduced, existing methods often struggle to explicitly capture the logical relationships among experiences or memory units. Moreover, memory access is largely detached from the constructed structure and still depends on shallow semantic retrieval, preventing agents from reasoning logically over long-horizon dependencies. In this work, we propose CompassMem, an event-centric memory framework inspired by Event Segmentation Theory. CompassMem organizes memory as an Event Graph by incrementally segmenting experiences into events and linking them through explicit logical relations. This graph serves as a logic map, enabling agents to perform structured and goal-directed navigation over memory beyond superficial retrieval, progressively gathering valuable memories to support long-horizon reasoning. Experiments on LoCoMo and NarrativeQA demonstrate that CompassMem consistently improves both retrieval and reasoning performance across multiple backbone models."}

We argue that a key reason is that these standards densely include tables to present essential information, yet the LLM knowledge and interpretation ability of such tables remains largely unexamined. To address this gap, we introduce TeleTables, a benchmark designed to evaluate both the implicit knowledge LLMs have about tables in technical specifications and their explicit ability to interpret them. TeleTables is built through a novel multi-stage data generation pipeline that extracts tables from 3GPP standards and uses multimodal and reasoning-oriented LLMs to generate and validate questions. The resulting dataset, which is publicly available, comprises 500 human-verified question-answer pairs, each associated with the corresponding table in multiple formats. Our evaluation shows that, smaller models (under 10B parameters) struggle both to recall 3GPP knowledge and to interpret tables, indicating the limited exposure to telecom standards in their pretraining and the insufficient inductive biases for navigating complex technical material. Larger models, on the other hand, show stronger reasoning on table interpretation. Overall, TeleTables highlights the need for domain-specialized fine-tuning to reliably interpret and reason over telecom standards."}

At each timestep, the remasking strategy of a DLM selects low-priority tokens to defer their decoding, thereby improving both efficiency and output quality. However, mainstream remasking strategies rely on a single global confidence threshold, overlooking the temporal and spatial dynamics of individual tokens. Motivated by the redundant iterations and constrained parallelism introduced by fixed-threshold remasking, we propose a novel remasking approach that dynamically detects Temporal Variance and Spatial Deviance of each token, which reflect its convergence status and inter-token correlations. Using these signals, our method adaptively adjusts the confidence threshold for every token at every step. Empirical results show that our approach significantly improves the operational efficiency of DLMs across mainstream datasets, achieving speedups of up to 8.9 times while faithfully preserving generation quality."}

Complementing this, we propose Agentic Turn-based Policy Optimization, a turn-level learning objective that aligns policy updates with the natural decision granularity of agentic interactions. ATPO is orthogonal to tree search and can be readily integrated into any multi-turn RL pipeline. Experiments across seven benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements over the state-of-the-art baseline by up to 1.84 percentage points in average, with ablation studies validating the effectiveness of each component.

Existing mitigation strategies, such as textual filtering or random video perturbations, often fail to address the root cause: over-reliance on language priors rather than fine-grained visual dynamics. We propose a scalable framework for counterfactual video generation that synthesizes videos differing only in actions or temporal structure while preserving scene context. Our pipeline combines multimodal LLMs for action proposal and editing guidance with diffusion-based image and video models to generate semantic hard negatives at scale. Using this framework, we build CounterVid, a synthetic dataset of ~26k preference pairs targeting action recognition and temporal reasoning. We further introduce MixDPO, a unified Direct Preference Optimization approach that jointly leverages textual and visual preferences. Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL with MixDPO yields consistent improvements, notably in temporal ordering, and transfers effectively to standard video hallucination benchmarks.

Prevailing explainable AI techniques rely on post hoc numerical feature attributions, which fail to provide coherent narratives behind model decisions. Large language models (LLMs) present an opportunity to generate natural-language explanations, but three design challenges remain unresolved: explanations must be both decision-correct and faithful to the factors that drive the prediction; they should be able to serve multiple audiences without shifting the underlying decision rule; and they should be trained in a label-efficient way that does not depend on large corpora of human-scored explanations. To address these challenges, we introduce LEXMA (LLM-based EXplanations for Multi-Audience decisions), a reinforcement-learning-based fine-tuning framework that produces narrative-driven, audience-appropriate explanations. LEXMA combines reflection-augmented supervised fine-tuning with two stages of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Specifically, it fine-tunes two separate parameter sets to improve decision correctness and satisfy stylistic requirements for different audiences, using reward signals that do not rely on human-annotated explanations. We instantiate LEXMA in the context of mortgage approval decisions. Results demonstrate that LEXMA yields significant improvements in predictive performance compared with other LLM baselines. Moreover, human evaluations show that expert-facing explanations generated by our approach are more risk-focused, and consumer-facing explanations are clearer, more actionable, and more polite. Our study contributes a cost-efficient, systematic LLM fine-tuning approach to enhance explanation quality for business decisions, offering strong potential for scalable deployment of transparent AI systems."}

By embedding adversarial instructions into the results of tool calls, attackers can hijack the agent's decision-making process to execute unauthorized actions. This vulnerability poses a significant risk as agents gain more direct control over physical environments. Existing defense mechanisms against Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI) generally fall into two categories. The first involves training dedicated detection models; however, this approach entails high computational overhead for both training and inference, and requires frequent updates to keep pace with evolving attack vectors. Alternatively, prompt-based methods leverage the inherent capabilities of LLMs to detect or ignore malicious instructions via prompt engineering. Despite their flexibility, most current prompt-based defenses suffer from high Attack Success Rates (ASR), demonstrating limited robustness against sophisticated injection attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel method that provides LLMs with precise data via tool result parsing while effectively filtering out injected malicious code. Our approach achieves competitive Utility under Attack (UA) while maintaining the lowest Attack Success Rate (ASR) to date, significantly outperforming existing methods.

We propose a Dynamic Rank LoRA framework named DR-LoRA, which dynamically grows expert LoRA ranks during fine-tuning based on task-specific demands. DR-LoRA employs an Expert Saliency Scoring mechanism that integrates expert routing frequency and LoRA rank importance to quantify each expert's demand for additional capacity. Experts with higher saliency scores are prioritized for rank expansion, enabling the automatic formation of a heterogeneous rank distribution tailored to the target task. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that DR-LoRA consistently outperforms standard LoRA and static allocation strategies under the same parameter budget, achieving superior task performance with more efficient parameter utilization."}

Stewart", "Markus J.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer inferential capabilities, they often depend on retrieval-augmented contexts that lack structural depth. Traditional Knowledge Graphs (KGs) attempt to bridge this gap, yet their pairwise constraints fail to capture the irreducible higher-order interactions that govern emergent physical behavior. To address this, we introduce a methodology for constructing hypergraph-based knowledge representations that faithfully encode multi-entity relationships. Applied to a corpus of ~1,100 manuscripts on biocomposite scaffolds, our framework constructs a global hypergraph of 161,172 nodes and 320,201 hyperedges, revealing a scale-free topology (power law exponent ~1.23) organized around highly connected conceptual hubs. This representation prevents the combinatorial explosion typical of pairwise expansions and explicitly preserves the co-occurrence context of scientific formulations. We further demonstrate that equipping agentic systems with hypergraph traversal tools, specifically using node-intersection constraints, enables them to bridge semantically distant concepts. By exploiting these higher-order pathways, the system successfully generates grounded mechanistic hypotheses for novel composite materials, such as linking cerium oxide to PCL scaffolds via chitosan intermediates. This work establishes a \"teacherless\" agentic reasoning system where hypergraph topology acts as a verifiable guardrail, accelerating scientific discovery by uncovering relationships obscured by traditional graph methods."}

Unlike prior work relying on external generators, BiForget exploits the target model per se to elicit data that matches its internal knowledge distribution through seed-guided and adversarial prompting. Our experiments across diverse benchmarks show that it achieves a superior balance of relevance, diversity, and efficiency. Quantitatively, in the Harry Potter domain, it improves relevance by ${\\sim}20$ and diversity by ${\\sim}$0.05 while halving the total data size compared to SOTAs. Ultimately, it facilitates more robust forgetting and better utility preservation, providing a more rigorous foundation for evaluating LLM unlearning."}

While Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on reasoning traces is a standard paradigm for the 'cold start' phase, applying existing compression techniques to these traces often compromises logical coherence or incurs prohibitive sampling costs. In this paper, we introduce ConMax (Confidence-Maximizing Compression), a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to automatically compress reasoning traces while preserving essential reasoning patterns. ConMax formulates compression as a reward-driven optimization problem, training a policy to prune redundancy by maximizing a weighted combination of answer confidence for predictive fidelity and thinking confidence for reasoning validity through a frozen auxiliary LRM. Extensive experiments across five reasoning datasets demonstrate that ConMax achieves a superior efficiency-performance trade-off. Specifically, it reduces inference length by 43% over strong baselines at the cost of a mere 0.7% dip in accuracy, proving its effectiveness in generating high-quality, efficient training data for LRMs."}

This work explores post-training to achieve fully unified text-image generation, where models autonomously transition from textual reasoning to visual synthesis within a single inference process. We examine the impact of joint text-image generation on T2I performance and the relative importance of each modality during post-training. We additionally explore different post-training data strategies, showing that a targeted dataset addressing specific limitations achieves superior results compared to broad image-caption corpora or benchmark-aligned data. Using offline, reward-weighted post-training with fully self-generated synthetic data, our approach enables improvements in multimodal image generation across four diverse T2I benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of reward-weighting both modalities and strategically designed post-training data."}

To overcome these limitations, we propose Disco-RAG, a discourse-aware framework that explicitly injects discourse signals into the generation process. Our method constructs intra-chunk discourse trees to capture local hierarchies and builds inter-chunk rhetorical graphs to model cross-passage coherence. These structures are jointly integrated into a planning blueprint that conditions the generation.

Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-based extensions improve upon vanilla RLVR (e.g., GRPO) by providing tree-based reasoning rollouts that enable fine-grained and segment-level credit assignment. However, existing methods still suffer from limited exploration diversity and inefficient reasoning. To address the above challenges, we propose reinforced efficient reasoning via semantically diverse explorations, i.e., ROSE, for LLMs. To encourage more diverse reasoning exploration, our method incorporates a semantic-entropy-based branching strategy and an $\\varepsilon$-exploration mechanism. The former operates on already sampled reasoning rollouts to capture semantic uncertainty and select branching points with high semantic divergence to generate new successive reasoning paths, whereas the latter stochastically initiates reasoning rollouts from the root, preventing the search process from becoming overly local. To improve efficiency, we design a length-aware segment-level advantage estimator that rewards concise and correct reasoning while penalizing unnecessarily long reasoning chains. Extensive experiments on various mathematical reasoning benchmarks with Qwen and Llama models validate the effectiveness and efficiency of ROSE.

We study whether a single flow-matching foundation model pre-trained primarily on RGB images can be repurposed as a cross-spectral translator using only a few co-measured examples, and whether the resulting synthetic data can enhance downstream detection. Starting from FLUX.1 Kontext, we insert low-rank adaptation (LoRA) modules and fine-tune them on just 100 paired images per domain for two settings: RGB to IR on the KAIST dataset and RGB to SAR on the M4-SAR dataset. The adapted model translates RGB images into pixel-aligned IR/SAR, enabling us to reuse existing bounding boxes and train object detection models purely in the target modality. Across a grid of LoRA hyperparameters, we find that LPIPS computed on only 50 held-out pairs is a strong proxy for downstream performance: lower LPIPS consistently predicts higher mAP for YOLOv11n on both IR and SAR, and for DETR on KAIST IR test data. Using the best LPIPS-selected LoRA adapter, synthetic IR from external RGB datasets (LLVIP, FLIR ADAS) improves KAIST IR pedestrian detection, and synthetic SAR significantly boosts infrastructure detection on M4-SAR when combined with limited real SAR. Our results suggest that few-shot LoRA adaptation of flow-matching foundation models is a promising path toward foundation-style support for non-visible modalities."}

However, achieving strong performance across these domains with a single general-purpose model typically requires scaling to sizes that are prohibitively expensive to train and deploy. On the other hand, while smaller domain-specialized models are much more efficient, they struggle to generalize beyond their training distributions. To address this dilemma, we propose FusionRoute, a robust and effective token-level multi-LLM collaboration framework in which a lightweight router simultaneously (i) selects the most suitable expert at each decoding step and (ii) contributes a complementary logit that refines or corrects the selected expert's next-token distribution via logit addition. Unlike existing token-level collaboration methods that rely solely on fixed expert outputs, we provide a theoretical analysis showing that pure expert-only routing is fundamentally limited: unless strong global coverage assumptions hold, it cannot in general realize the optimal decoding policy. By augmenting expert selection with a trainable complementary generator, FusionRoute expands the effective policy class and enables recovery of optimal value functions under mild conditions. Empirically, across both Llama-3 and Gemma-2 families and diverse benchmarks spanning mathematical reasoning, code generation, and instruction following, FusionRoute outperforms both sequence- and token-level collaboration, model merging, and direct fine-tuning, while remaining competitive with domain experts on their respective tasks."}

In real-world applications, previously deployed LLMs may influence the data they generate, leading to a dynamic system driven by user feedback. For example, if a model continues to underserve users from a group, less query data will be collected from this particular demographic of users. In this study, we introduce the concept of \\textbf{S}elf-\\textbf{C}onsuming \\textbf{P}erformative \\textbf{L}oop (\\textbf{SCPL}) and investigate the role of synthetic data in shaping bias during these dynamic iterative training processes under controlled performative feedback.

We focus on two types of loops, including the typical retraining setting and the incremental fine-tuning setting, which is largely underexplored. Through experiments on three real-world tasks, we find that the performative loop increases preference bias and decreases disparate bias.

An important step in this procedure is mastoidectomy, which removes part of the mastoid region of the temporal bone to provide surgical access. Accurate mastoidectomy shape prediction from preoperative imaging improves pre-surgical planning, reduces risks, and enhances surgical outcomes. Despite its importance, there are limited deep-learning-based studies regarding this topic due to the challenges of acquiring ground-truth labels. We address this gap by investigating self-supervised and weakly-supervised learning models to predict the mastoidectomy region without human annotations. We propose a hybrid self-supervised and weakly-supervised learning framework to predict the mastoidectomy region directly from preoperative CT scans, where the mastoid remains intact. Our hybrid method achieves a mean Dice score of 0.72 when predicting the complex and boundary-less mastoidectomy shape, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches and demonstrating strong performance. The method provides groundwork for constructing 3D postmastoidectomy surfaces directly from the corresponding preoperative CT scans. To our knowledge, this is the first work that integrating self-supervised and weakly-supervised learning for mastoidectomy shape prediction, offering a robust and efficient solution for CI surgical planning while leveraging 3D T-distribution loss in weakly-supervised medical imaging."}

We study this failure mode in a controlled object-counting setting, where the prompt overstates the number of objects in the image (e.g., asking a model to describe four waterlilies when only three are present). At low object counts, models often correct the overestimation, but as the number of objects increases, they increasingly conform to the prompt regardless of the discrepancy. Through mechanistic analysis of three VLMs, we identify a small set of attention heads whose ablation substantially reduces prompt-induced hallucinations (PIH) by at least 40% without additional training. Across models, PIH-heads mediate prompt copying in model-specific ways. We characterize these differences and show that PIH ablation increases correction toward visual evidence. Our findings offer insights into the internal mechanisms driving prompt-induced hallucinations, revealing model-specific differences in how these behaviors are implemented."}

Most existing models are designed to handle only a single or narrow subset of these variations, leading to performance degradation when faced with distribution shifts. Therefore, it is beneficial to develop a unified model capable of generalizing across diverse CMR scenarios. To this end, we propose CRUNet-MR-Univ, a foundation model that leverages spatio-temporal correlations and prompt-based priors to effectively handle the full diversity of CMR scans. Our approach consistently outperforms baseline methods across a wide range of settings, highlighting its effectiveness and promise."}

Despite this growing risk, defenses for instruction-tuned models remain underexplored. We propose MB-Defense (Merging & Breaking Defense Framework), a novel training pipeline that immunizes instruction-tuned LLMs against diverse backdoor threats. MB-Defense comprises two stages: (i) defensive poisoning, which merges attacker and defensive triggers into a unified backdoor representation, and (ii) weight recovery, which breaks this representation through additional training to restore clean behavior. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs show that MB-Defense substantially lowers attack success rates while preserving instruction-following ability.

Most research focuses on how to organize and use memory summary, but often overlooks the initial memory extraction stage. In this paper, we argue that existing summary-based methods have two major limitations based on the recurrent processing theory. First, summarization is \"ahead-of-time\", acting as a blind \"feed-forward\" process that misses important details because it doesn't know future tasks. Second, extraction is usually \"one-off\", lacking a feedback loop to verify facts, which leads to the accumulation of information loss. To address these issues, we propose proactive memory extraction (namely ProMem). Unlike static summarization, ProMem treats extraction as an iterative cognitive process. We introduce a recurrent feedback loop where the agent uses self-questioning to actively probe the dialogue history. This mechanism allows the agent to recover missing information and correct errors. Our ProMem significantly improves the completeness of the extracted memory and QA accuracy. It also achieves a superior trade-off between extraction quality and token cost."}

First, we study hallucinations in closed-book question answering on HotpotQA and find a directional effect: negating the hallucination token reduces hallucinated answers mainly by increasing abstentions, whereas asserting it increases hallucinations and lowers precision. Second, we induce recasting, a pedagogical feedback strategy for second language teaching, and observe the same directional effect. Moreover, compared to providing the full definitional corpus in-context, concept tokens better preserve compliance with other instructions (e.g., asking follow-up questions).

To address this gap, we introduce an LLM-driven agent for integrated forest change analysis that supports natural language querying across multiple RSICI tasks.

To overcome this obstacle under a low-data scenario, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning (SSL) method dubbed SemiMol, which employs predictions on numerous unannotated data as pseudo-signals for subsequent training. Specifically, we introduce an additional instructor model to evaluate the accuracy and trustworthiness of proxy labels because existing pseudo-labeling approaches require probabilistic outputs to reveal the model's confidence and fail to be applied in regression tasks. Moreover, we design a self-adaptive curriculum learning algorithm to progressively move the target model toward hard samples at a controllable pace. Extensive experiments on 30 activity cliff datasets demonstrate that SemiMol significantly enhances graph-based ML architectures and outpasses state-of-the-art pretraining and SSL baselines."}

To bridge this gap, we first develop a refined taxonomy of 21 vocal events, with a new categorization into discrete (standalone) versus continuous (mixed with speech) types. Based on the refined taxonomy, we introduce WESR-Bench, an expert-annotated evaluation set (900+ utterances) with a novel position-aware protocol that disentangles ASR errors from event detection, enabling precise localization measurement for both discrete and continuous events. We also build a strong baseline by constructing a 1,700+ hour corpus, and train specialized models, surpassing both open-source audio-language models and commercial APIs while preserving ASR quality. We anticipate that WESR will serve as a foundational resource for future research in modeling rich, real-world auditory scenes."}

In this paper, we introduce a fully convolutional, conditionally parameterized U-Net surrogate designed to extrapolate far beyond its training data in both space and time. The architecture integrates convolutional self-attention, physically informed padding, and a flood-fill corrector method to maintain accuracy under extreme extrapolation, while conditioning on simulation parameters allows for flexible time-step skipping and adaptation to varying alloy compositions. To remove the need for costly solver-based initialization, we couple the surrogate with a conditional diffusion model that generates synthetic, physically consistent initial conditions. We train our surrogate on simulations generated over small domain sizes and short time spans, but, by taking advantage of the convolutional nature of U-Nets, we are able to run and extrapolate surrogate simulations for longer time horizons than what would be achievable with classic numerical solvers. Across multiple alloy compositions, the framework is able to reproduce the LMD physics accurately. It predicts key quantities of interest and spatial statistics with relative errors typically below 5% in the training regime and under 15% during large-scale, long time-horizon extrapolations. Our framework can also deliver speed-ups of up to 36,000 times, bringing the time to run weeks-long simulations down to a few seconds.

This work presents the first systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art text watermarking methods: KGW, Exponential Sampling (EXP), and Waterfall, for Bangla LLM text generation under cross-lingual round-trip translation (RTT) attacks. Under benign conditions, KGW and EXP achieve high detection accuracy (>88%) with negligible perplexity and ROUGE degradation. However, RTT causes detection accuracy to collapse below RTT causes detection accuracy to collapse to 9-13%, indicating a fundamental failure of token-level watermarking. To address this, we propose a layered watermarking strategy that combines embedding-time and post-generation watermarks. Experimental results show that layered watermarking improves post-RTT detection accuracy by 25-35%, achieving 40-50% accuracy, representing a 3$\\times$ to 4$\\times$ relative improvement over single-layer methods, at the cost of controlled semantic degradation.

Moreover, these approaches focus only on supportive neurons that correlate positively with task completion, while neglecting neurons with other roles-such as inhibitive roles-and misled neuron attribution due to fortuitous behaviors in LLMs (i.e., correctly answer the questions by chance rather than genuine understanding). To address these challenges, we propose NeuronLLM, a novel task-level LLM understanding framework that adopts the biological principle of functional antagonism for LLM neuron identification. The key insight is that task performance is jointly determined by neurons with two opposing roles: good neurons that facilitate task completion and bad neurons that inhibit it. NeuronLLM achieves a holistic modeling of neurons via contrastive learning of good and bad neurons, while leveraging augmented question sets to mitigate the fortuitous behaviors in LLMs. Comprehensive experiments on LLMs of different sizes and families show the superiority of NeuronLLM over existing methods in four NLP tasks, providing new insights into LLM functional organization."}

First, the \"hopping-too-late\" problem occurs as later layers lack access to necessary intermediate representations. Second, generalization ability deteriorates sharply when editing later layers. Third, the model overfits to edited knowledge, incorrectly prioritizing edited-hop answers regardless of context.

ToolGate maintains an explicit symbolic state space as a typed key-value mapping representing trusted world information throughout the reasoning process. Each tool is formalized as a Hoare-style contract consisting of a precondition and a postcondition, where the precondition gates tool invocation by checking whether the current state satisfies the required conditions, and the postcondition determines whether the tool's result can be committed to update the state through runtime verification.

To address them, we propose an end-to-end framework that first performs knowledge-graph-guided harmful prompt generation to systematically produce domain-relevant prompts, and then applies dual-path obfuscation rewriting to convert explicit harmful prompts into implicit variants via direct and context-enhanced rewriting. This framework yields high-quality datasets combining strong domain relevance with implicitness, enabling more realistic red-teaming and advancing LLM safety research. We release our code and datasets at GitHub."}

While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in patent and legal practice, their use has remained limited to lightweight tasks, with no established means of systematically evaluating their capacity for structured legal reasoning in the patent domain. In this work, we introduce PILOT-Bench, the first PTAB-centric benchmark that aligns PTAB decisions with USPTO patent data at the case-level and formalizes three IRAC-aligned classification tasks: Issue Type, Board Authorities, and Subdecision. We evaluate a diverse set of closed-source (commercial) and open-source LLMs and conduct analyses across multiple perspectives, including input-variation settings, model families, and error tendencies. Notably, on the Issue Type task, closed-source models consistently exceed 0.75 in Micro-F1 score, whereas the strongest open-source model (Qwen-8B) achieves performance around 0.56, highlighting a substantial gap in reasoning capabilities. PILOT-Bench establishes a foundation for the systematic evaluation of patent-domain legal reasoning and points toward future directions for improving LLMs through dataset design and model alignment.

Recently, some methods begin to address multi-image grounding. However, they are constrained by single-target localization and limited types of practical tasks, due to the lack of unified modeling for generalized grounding tasks. Therefore, we propose GeM-VG, an MLLM capable of Generalized Multi-image Visual Grounding. To support this, we systematically categorize and organize existing multi-image grounding tasks according to their reliance of cross-image cues and reasoning, and introduce the MG-Data-240K dataset, addressing the limitations of existing datasets regarding target quantity and image relation. To tackle the challenges of robustly handling diverse multi-image grounding tasks, we further propose a hybrid reinforcement finetuning strategy that integrates chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and direct answering, considering their complementary strengths. This strategy adopts an R1-like algorithm guided by a carefully designed rule-based reward, effectively enhancing the model's overall perception and reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior generalized grounding capabilities of our model. For multi-image grounding, it outperforms the previous leading MLLMs by 2.0% and 9.7% on MIG-Bench and MC-Bench, respectively. In single-image grounding, it achieves a 9.1% improvement over the base model on ODINW. Furthermore, our model retains strong capabilities in general multi-image understanding."}

We propose a scalable framework for counterfactual video generation that synthesizes videos differing only in actions or temporal structure while preserving scene context. Our pipeline combines multimodal LLMs for action proposal and editing guidance with diffusion-based image and video models to generate semantic hard negatives at scale.

Experiments with GPT-4o and DeepSeek R1 reveal that Expert and Referent power roles exert stronger influence than Legitimate power roles. Crucially, authority bias emerges not through active conformity by general agents, but through authoritative roles consistently maintaining their positions while general agents demonstrate flexibility. Furthermore, authority influence requires clear position statements, as neutral responses fail to generate bias. These findings provide key insights for designing multi-agent frameworks with asymmetric interaction patterns."}

This early discretization forces uncertainty to be resolved through token-level sampling, often leading to instability, repetition, and sensitivity to decoding heuristics.\n  In this work, we introduce a continuous autoregressive formulation of language generation in which tokens are represented as continuous vectors that \\emph{mature} over multiple update steps before being discretized. Rather than sampling tokens, the model evolves continuous token representations through a deterministic dynamical process, committing to a discrete token only when the representation has sufficiently converged. Discrete text is recovered via hard decoding, while uncertainty is maintained and resolved in the continuous space.\n  We show that this maturation process alone is sufficient to produce coherent and diverse text using deterministic decoding (argmax), without reliance on token-level sampling, diffusion-style denoising, or auxiliary stabilization mechanisms. Additional perturbations, such as stochastic dynamics or history smoothing, can be incorporated naturally but are not required for the model to function.\n  To our knowledge, this is the first autoregressive language model that generates text by evolving continuous token representations to convergence prior to discretization, enabling stable generation without token-level sampling."}

Our analysis suggests that SFT induces a \"Cargo Cult\" effect, where students ritualistically replicate the linguistic form of reasoning (verbosity) without internalizing the teacher's dynamic resource allocation policy.

We introduce a two-stage training framework, including warm-up and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to teach the model to balance independence with strategic help-seeking. Empirical results across six benchmarks demonstrate that RelayLLM achieves an average accuracy of 49.52%, effectively bridging the performance gap between the two models. Notably, this is achieved by invoking the LLM for only 1.07% of the total generated tokens, offering a 98.2% cost reduction compared to performance-matched random routers."}

However, most recent vision--language models (VLMs) are constrained to a fixed and finite set of input views, which limits their ability to acquire question-relevant context at inference time and hinders complex spatial reasoning. We propose Chain-of-View (CoV) prompting, a training-free, test-time reasoning framework that transforms a VLM into an active viewpoint reasoner through a coarse-to-fine exploration process. CoV first employs a View Selection agent to filter redundant frames and identify question-aligned anchor views. It then performs fine-grained view adjustment by interleaving iterative reasoning with discrete camera actions, obtaining new observations from the underlying 3D scene representation until sufficient context is gathered or a step budget is reached.\n  We evaluate CoV on OpenEQA across four mainstream VLMs and obtain an average +11.56\\% improvement in LLM-Match, with a maximum gain of +13.62\\% on Qwen3-VL-Flash. CoV further exhibits test-time scaling: increasing the minimum action budget yields an additional +2.51\\% average improvement, peaking at +3.73\\% on Gemini-2.5-Flash. On ScanQA and SQA3D, CoV delivers strong performance (e.g., 116 CIDEr / 31.9 EM@1 on ScanQA and 51.1 EM@1 on SQA3D). Overall, these results suggest that question-aligned view selection coupled with open-view search is an effective, model-agnostic strategy for improving spatial reasoning in 3D EQA without additional training."}

We study this failure mode in a controlled object-counting setting, where the prompt overstates the number of objects in the image (e.g., asking a model to describe four waterlilies when only three are present). At low object counts, models often correct the overestimation, but as the number of objects increases, they increasingly conform to the prompt regardless of the discrepancy. Through mechanistic analysis of three VLMs, we identify a small set of attention heads whose ablation substantially reduces prompt-induced hallucinations (PIH) by at least 40% without additional training. Across models, PIH-heads mediate prompt copying in model-specific ways. We characterize these differences and show that PIH ablation increases correction toward visual evidence. Our findings offer insights into the internal mechanisms driving prompt-induced hallucinations, revealing model-specific differences in how these behaviors are implemented."}

However, due to hardware and physical setup constraints, collecting large-scale real-world manipulation data remains difficult to scale across diverse environments. Recent work uses text-prompt conditioned image diffusion models to augment manipulation data by altering the backgrounds and tabletop objects in the visual observations. However, these approaches often overlook the practical need for multi-view and temporally coherent observations required by state-of-the-art policy models. Further, text prompts alone cannot reliably specify the scene setup. To provide the diffusion model with explicit visual guidance, we introduce visual identity prompting, which supplies exemplar images as conditioning inputs to guide the generation of the desired scene setup. To this end, we also build a scalable pipeline to curate a visual identity pool from large robotics datasets. Using our augmented manipulation data to train downstream vision-language-action and visuomotor policy models yields consistent performance gains in both simulation and real-robot settings."}

To achieve this, Reinforcement learning (RL) pipelines have begun incorporating multiple rewards, each capturing a distinct preference, to guide models toward these desired behaviors. However, recent work has defaulted to apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) under multi-reward setting without examining its suitability. In this paper, we demonstrate that directly applying GRPO to normalize distinct rollout reward combinations causes them to collapse into identical advantage values, reducing the resolution of the training signal and resulting in suboptimal convergence and, in some cases, early training failure. We then introduce Group reward-Decoupled Normalization Policy Optimization (GDPO), a new policy optimization method to resolve these issues by decoupling the normalization of individual rewards, more faithfully preserving their relative differences and enabling more accurate multi-reward optimization, along with substantially improved training stability. We compare GDPO with GRPO across three tasks: tool calling, math reasoning, and coding reasoning, evaluating both correctness metrics (accuracy, bug ratio) and constraint adherence metrics (format, length). Across all settings, GDPO consistently outperforms GRPO, demonstrating its effectiveness and generalizability for multi-reward reinforcement learning optimization."}
