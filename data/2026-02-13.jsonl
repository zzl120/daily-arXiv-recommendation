While prior work has focused on accuracy, social interaction modeling, and diversity, little attention has been paid to uncertainty modeling, calibration, and forecasts from short observation periods, which are crucial for downstream tasks such as path planning and collision avoidance. We propose DD-MDN, an end-to-end probabilistic HTF model that combines high positional accuracy, calibrated uncertainty, and robustness to short observations. Using a few-shot denoising diffusion backbone and a dual mixture density network, our method learns self-calibrated residence areas and probability-ranked anchor paths, from which diverse trajectory hypotheses are derived, without predefined anchors or endpoints. Experiments on the ETH/UCY, SDD, inD, and IMPTC datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy, robustness at short observation intervals, and reliable uncertainty modeling.

This requirement is crucial when the point cloud must lie non-negotiably on the final surface to preserve sharp features and fine geometric details. However, the task becomes substantially challenging with low-quality point clouds, due to inherent reconstruction ambiguities compounded by combinatorial complexity. A previous method using filmsticking technique by iteratively compute restricted Voronoi diagram to address these issues, ensures to produce a watertight manifold, setting a new benchmark as the state-of-the-art (SOTA) technique. Unfortunately, RVD-based filmsticking is inability to interpolate all points in the case of deep internal cavities, resulting in very likely is the generation of faulty topology. The cause of this issue is that RVD-based filmsticking has inherent limitations due to Euclidean distance metrics. In this paper, we extend the filmsticking technique, named Filmsticking++. Filmsticking++ reconstructing an explicit surface from points without normals. On one hand, Filmsticking++ break through the inherent limitations of Euclidean distance by employing a weighted-distance-based Restricted Power Diagram, which guarantees that all points are interpolated. On the other hand, we observe that as the guiding surface increasingly approximates the target shape, the external medial axis is gradually expelled outside the guiding surface. Building on this observation, we propose placing virtual sites inside the guiding surface to accelerate the expulsion of the external medial axis from its interior. To summarize, contrary to the SOTA method, Filmsticking++ demonstrates multiple benefits, including decreases computational cost, improved robustness and scalability."}

Progress is hindered by fragmented data, inconsistent representations, and misaligned training objectives. We present ABot-M0, a framework that builds a systematic data curation pipeline while jointly optimizing model architecture and training strategies, enabling end-to-end transformation of heterogeneous raw data into unified, efficient representations. From six public datasets, we clean, standardize, and balance samples to construct UniACT-dataset, a large-scale dataset with over 6 million trajectories and 9,500 hours of data, covering diverse robot morphologies and task scenarios. Unified pre-training improves knowledge transfer and generalization across platforms and tasks, supporting general-purpose embodied intelligence. To improve action prediction efficiency and stability, we propose the Action Manifold Hypothesis: effective robot actions lie not in the full high-dimensional space but on a low-dimensional, smooth manifold governed by physical laws and task constraints. Based on this, we introduce Action Manifold Learning (AML), which uses a DiT backbone to predict clean, continuous action sequences directly. This shifts learning from denoising to projection onto feasible manifolds, improving decoding speed and policy stability. ABot-M0 supports modular perception via a dual-stream mechanism that integrates VLM semantics with geometric priors and multi-view inputs from plug-and-play 3D modules such as VGGT and Qwen-Image-Edit, enhancing spatial understanding without modifying the backbone and mitigating standard VLM limitations in 3D reasoning. Experiments show components operate independently with additive benefits. We will release all code and pipelines for reproducibility and future research."}

We address this by leveraging the repetition of leaf shapes; our method segments leaves from the unstructured 3DGS, with optional user interaction included as a fallback. A representative leaf group is selected and converted into a thin, sharp mesh to serve as a template; this template is then fitted to all other leaves via differentiable Moving Least Squares (MLS) deformation. At runtime, the deformation is evaluated efficiently on-the-fly using a vertex shader to minimize storage requirements.

So, tea cultivation plays an important role to boost the economy. These valuable plants are vulnerable to various kinds of leaf infections which may cause less production and low quality. It is not so easy to detect these diseases manually.

There are 5,278 high-resolution images in this dataset. The images are classified into seven categories. Six of them represents various diseases and the rest one represents healthy leaves. The proposed pipeline contains data preprocessing, data splitting, adversarial training, augmentation, model training, evaluation, and comprehension made possible with Explainable AI strategies. DenseNet201 and EfficientNetB3 were employed to perform the classification task. To prepare the model more robustly, we applied adversarial training so it can operate effectively even with noisy or disturbed inputs. In addition, Grad-CAM visualization was executed to analyze the model's predictions by identifying the most influential regions of each image. Our experimental outcomes revealed that EfficientNetB3 achieved the highest classification accuracy of 93%, while DenseNet201 reached 91%.

These approaches operate by first applying edits in the rendered 2D space and subsequently projecting the modifications back into 3D. However, this paradigm inevitably introduces cross-view inconsistencies and constrains both the flexibility and efficiency of the editing process. To address these challenges, we present VF-Editor, which enables native editing of Gaussian primitives by predicting attribute variations in a feedforward manner. To accurately and efficiently estimate these variations, we design a novel variation predictor distilled from 2D editing knowledge. The predictor encodes the input to generate a variation field and employs two learnable, parallel decoding functions to iteratively infer attribute changes for each 3D Gaussian. Thanks to its unified design, VF-Editor can seamlessly distill editing knowledge from diverse 2D editors and strategies into a single predictor, allowing for flexible and effective knowledge transfer into the 3D domain. Extensive experiments on both public and private datasets reveal the inherent limitations of indirect editing pipelines and validate the effectiveness and flexibility of our approach."}

However, existing self-play methods for vision-language models rely on passive interaction with static image collections, resulting in strong dependence on initial datasets and inefficient learning. Without the ability to actively seek visual data tailored to their evolving capabilities, agents waste computational effort on samples that are either trivial or beyond their current skill level. To address these limitations, we propose Active-Zero, a framework that shifts from passive interaction to active exploration of visual environments. Active-Zero employs three co-evolving agents: a Searcher that retrieves images from open-world repositories based on the model's capability frontier, a Questioner that synthesizes calibrated reasoning tasks, and a Solver refined through accuracy rewards. This closed loop enables self-scaffolding auto-curricula where the model autonomously constructs its learning trajectory. On Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct across 12 benchmarks, Active-Zero achieves 53.97 average accuracy on reasoning tasks (5.7% improvement) and 59.77 on general understanding (3.9% improvement), consistently outperforming existing self-play baselines.

We identified three desirable attributes of avatar generation: 1) the method should be feed-forward, 2) model a 360° full-head, and 3) should be animation-ready. However, current work addresses only two of the three points simultaneously. To address these limitations, we propose OMEGA-Avatar, the first feed-forward framework that simultaneously generates a generalizable, 360°-complete, and animatable 3D Gaussian head from a single image. Starting from a feed-forward and animatable framework, we address the 360° full-head avatar generation problem with two novel components. First, to overcome poor hair modeling in full-head avatar generation, we introduce a semantic-aware mesh deformation module that integrates multi-view normals to optimize a FLAME head with hair while preserving its topology structure. Second, to enable effective feed-forward decoding of full-head features, we propose a multi-view feature splatting module that constructs a shared canonical UV representation from features across multiple views through differentiable bilinear splatting, hierarchical UV mapping, and visibility-aware fusion. This approach preserves both global structural coherence and local high-frequency details across all viewpoints, ensuring 360° consistency without per-instance optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OMEGA-Avatar achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing baselines in 360° full-head completeness while robustly preserving identity across different viewpoints."}

The framework is grounded in the concept of hyperelasticity with energy limiters and employs Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to separately learn the intact (undamaged) elastic response and damage evolution directly from data. In Stage I, GPR models learn the intact hyperelastic response through volumetric and isochoric response functions (or only the isochoric response under incompressibility), ensuring energetic consistency of the intact response and satisfaction of fundamental principles such as material frame indifference and balance of angular momentum. In Stage II, damage is modeled via a separate GPR model that learns the mapping between the intact strain energy density predicted by Stage I models and a stress-reduction factor governing damage and failure, with monotonicity, non-negativity, and complete-failure constraints enforced through penalty-based optimization to ensure thermodynamic admissibility. Validation on synthetic datasets, including benchmarking against analytical constitutive models and competing data-driven approaches, demonstrates high in-distribution accuracy under uniaxial tension and robust generalization from limited training data to compression and shear modes not used during training. Application to experimental brain tissue data demonstrates the practical applicability of the framework and enables inference of damage evolution and critical failure energy. Overall, the proposed framework combines the physical consistency, interpretability, and generalizability of analytical models with the flexibility, predictive accuracy, and automation of machine learning, offering a powerful approach for modeling failure in soft materials under limited experimental data."}

The simplest mode of non-convergence is cyclical or periodic behavior. Such cycles are fundamental objects, and have inspired a number of significant insights in the field, beginning with the pioneering work of Shapley (1964). However a central question remains unanswered: which cycles are stable under game dynamics? In this paper we give a complete and computational answer to this question for the two best-studied dynamics, fictitious play/best-response dynamics and the replicator dynamic. We show (1) that a periodic sequence of profiles is stable under one of these dynamics if and only it is stable under the other, and (2) we provide a polynomial-time spectral stability test to determine whether a given periodic sequence is stable under either dynamic. Finally, we give an entirely `structural' sufficient condition for stability: every cycle that is a sink equilibrium of the preference graph of the game is stable, and moreover it is an attractor of the replicator dynamic. This result generalizes the famous theorems of Shapley (1964) and Jordan (1993), and extends the frontier of recent work relating the preference graph to the replicator attractors."}

In this paper, we present HybridRAG, a novel and practical RAG framework towards more accurate and faster chatbot responses. First, HybridRAG ingests raw, unstructured PDF documents containing complex layouts (text, tables, figures) via Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and layout analysis, and convert them into hierarchical text chunks. Then, it pre-generates a plausible question-answer (QA) knowledge base from the organized chunks using an LLM. At query time, user questions are matched against this QA bank to retrieve immediate answers when possible, and only if no suitable QA match is found does our framework fall back to an on-the-fly response generation. Experiments on OHRBench demonstrate that our HybridRAG provides higher answer quality and lower latency compared to a standard RAG baseline. We believe that HybridRAG could be a practical solution for real-world chatbot applications that must handle large volumes of unstructured documents and lots of users under limited computational resources."}

At each FC antenna, there is one fixed-position active antenna and multiple passive couplers that can move within a designated region around the active antenna. Moreover, each FC antenna is equipped with a local processing unit (LPU). All LPUs exchange signals with a central processing unit (CPU) for joint signal processing. We study an FC-aided multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system, where an FC array base station (BS) is deployed to enhance the downlink communication between the BS and multiple single-antenna users. We formulate optimization problems to maximize the achievable sum rate of users by jointly optimizing the coupler positions and digital beamforming, subject to movement constraints on the coupler positions and the transmit power constraint. To address the resulting nonconvex optimization problem, the digital beamforming is expressed as a function of the FC position vectors, which are then optimized using the proposed distributed coupler position optimization algorithm. Considering a structured time domain pattern of pilots and coupler positions, pilot-assisted centralized and distributed channel estimation algorithms are designed under the FC array architecture. Simulation results demonstrate that the distributed FC array achieves substantial rate gains over conventional benchmarks in multiuser systems without moving active antennas, and approaches the performance of fully active arrays while significantly reducing hardware cost and power consumption. Moreover, the proposed channel estimation algorithms outperform the benchmark schemes in terms of both pilot overhead and channel reconstruction accuracy."}

This allows for vulnerabilities in non-English contexts, especially with low-resource languages. We introduce a novel application of knowledge distillation (KD) in the context of multilingual jailbreak prevention, examining its efficacy. We distill the refusal behaviors of a proprietary teacher model (OpenAI o1-mini) with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) into three open-source student models: Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct, Gemma-2-2B-IT, and Qwen3-8B, using ~28,000 multilingual jailbreak prompts from XSafety via black-box response-based, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). Evaluation on the MultiJail benchmark reveals a counterintuitive behavior: standard fine-tuning on the teacher's ``safe'' refusal data inadvertently increases Jailbreak Success Rate (JSR) for all student models, up to 16.6 percentage points. Our experiments reveal a divergent generalization to unseen languages during distillation, with varying outcomes depending on the base model. By removing a primary source of safety degradation, nuanced `boundary' refusals, we mitigate or even reverse safety declines in student models, although reductions in reasoning performance (GSM8K) persist. Overall, our exploratory study highlights the challenges and potential of KD as a technique for multilingual safety alignment, offering a foundation for future research in this direction."}

We introduce Latent Generative Solvers (LGS), a two-stage framework that (i) maps diverse PDE states into a shared latent physics space with a pretrained VAE, and (ii) learns probabilistic latent dynamics with a Transformer trained by flow matching. Our key mechanism is an uncertainty knob that perturbs latent inputs during training and inference, teaching the solver to correct off-manifold rollout drift and stabilizing autoregressive prediction. We further use flow forcing to update a system descriptor (context) from model-generated trajectories, aligning train/test conditioning and improving long-term stability. We pretrain on a curated corpus of $\\sim$2.5M trajectories at $128^2$ resolution spanning 12 PDE families. LGS matches strong deterministic neural-operator baselines on short horizons while substantially reducing rollout drift on long horizons. Learning in latent space plus efficient architectural choices yields up to \\textbf{70$\\times$} lower FLOPs than non-generative baselines, enabling scalable pretraining. We also show efficient adaptation to an out-of-distribution $256^2$ Kolmogorov flow dataset under limited finetuning budgets. Overall, LGS provides a practical route toward generalizable, uncertainty-aware neural PDE solvers that are more reliable for long-term forecasting and downstream scientific workflows."}

We test leading open- and closed-source VidLMs and find that these models confidently describe reversed scenes as forward, answer questions while neglecting video content, agree with false claims, struggle with basic camera motion, and fail to aggregate temporal information amidst simple spatiotemporal masking. Humans, on the other hand, succeed at these tasks with ease.

Remarkably, this is the same as the capacity of the channel in the NS-assisted non-causal CSIT setting, $C^{NS,nc}=\\max_{P_{X|S}}I(X;Y\\mid S)$, which was previously established, and also matches the (either classical or with NS assistance) capacity of the channel where the state is available not only (either causally or non-causally) to the transmitter but also to the receiver. While the capacity remains unchanged, the optimal probability of error for fixed message size and blocklength, in the NS-assisted causal CSIT setting can be further improved if channel state is made available to the receiver.

However, prior works largely rely on static statistics aggregated across datasets, identifying heads that perform retrieval on average. This perspective overlooks the fine-grained temporal dynamics of autoregressive generation. In this paper, we investigate retrieval heads from a dynamic perspective. Through extensive analysis, we establish three core claims: (1) Dynamism: Retrieval heads vary dynamically across timesteps; (2) Irreplaceability: Dynamic retrieval heads are specific at each timestep and cannot be effectively replaced by static retrieval heads; and (3) Correlation: The model's hidden state encodes a predictive signal for future retrieval head patterns, indicating an internal planning mechanism. We validate these findings on the Needle-in-a-Haystack task and a multi-hop QA task, and quantify the differences on the utility of dynamic and static retrieval heads in a Dynamic Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework.

Existing representations either rely on UV maps, which suffer from distortion during unwrapping, or point-based methods, which tightly couple texture fidelity to geometric density that limits high-resolution texture generation. To address these limitations, we introduce TexSpot, a diffusion-based texture enhancement framework. At its core is Texlet, a novel 3D texture representation that merges the geometric expressiveness of point-based 3D textures with the compactness of UV-based representation. Each Texlet latent vector encodes a local texture patch via a 2D encoder and is further aggregated using a 3D encoder to incorporate global shape context. A cascaded 3D-to-2D decoder reconstructs high-quality texture patches, enabling the Texlet space learning. Leveraging this representation, we train a diffusion transformer conditioned on Texlets to refine and enhance textures produced by multi-view diffusion methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TexSpot significantly improves visual fidelity, geometric consistency, and robustness over existing state-of-the-art 3D texture generation and enhancement approaches.

The process is based on the solidification of photopolymer that occurs when a sufficient threshold dose of light-energy is absorbed. In order to create complex shapes, an illumination plan must be designed to force solidification in some desired areas while leaving other regions liquid. Determining an illumination plan can be considered as an optimisation problem where a variety of objective functionals (penalties) can be used. This work considers a selection of penalty functions and their impact on selected printing metrics; linking the shape of penalty functions to ranges of light-energy dose levels in in-part regions that should be printed and out-of-part regions that should remain liquid. Further, the threshold parameters that are typically used to demarcate minimum light-energy for in-part regions and maximum light-energy for out-of-part regions are investigated systematically as design parameters on both existing and new methods. This enables the characterisation of their effects on some selected printing metrics as well as informed selection for default values. This work is underpinned by a reproducible and extensible framework, TVAM Adaptive Illumination Design(TVAM AID), which makes use of the open-source Core Imaging Library(CIL) that is designed for tomographic imaging with an emphasis on reconstruction. The foundation of TVAM AID which is presented here can hence be easily enhanced by existing functionality in CIL thus lowering the barrier to entry and encouraging use of strategies that already exist for reconstruction optimisation."}

The standard measure for evaluating ordinal mechanisms is the \\emph{distortion}, and the vast majority of the literature on distortion has focused on worst-case analysis, leading to some overly pessimistic results. We instead evaluate the distortion of mechanisms with respect to their expected performance when the agents' preferences are generated stochastically. We first show that no ordinal mechanism can achieve a distortion better than $e/(e-1)\\approx 1.582$, even if each agent needs to receive exactly one item (i.e., $m=n$) and every agent's values for different items are drawn i.i.d.\\ from the same known distribution. We then complement this negative result by proposing an ordinal mechanism that achieves the optimal distortion of $e/(e-1)$ even if each agent's values are drawn from an agent-specific distribution that is unknown to the mechanism. To further refine our analysis, we also optimize the \\emph{distortion gap}, i.e., the extent to which an ordinal mechanism approximates the optimal distortion possible for the instance at hand, and we propose a mechanism with a near-optimal distortion gap of $1.076$. Finally, we also evaluate the distortion and distortion gap of simple mechanisms that have a one-pass structure."}

The key technical ingredient is the notion of multiple equal-difference (MED) representations of the defining set of a simple-root polynomial, which generalizes the MED representation of a cyclotomic coset. We prove that every MED representation induces an upper bound on the minimum distance; the classical Singleton bound corresponds to the coarsest representation, while the strongest among these bounds is defined as the arithmetic Singleton bound. It is shown that the arithmetic Singleton bound is always at least as tight as the Singleton bound, and a precise criterion for it to be strictly tighter is obtained. For irreducible constacyclic codes, the bound is given explicitly by $ω+1$, where $ω$ is a constant closely related to the order of $q$ modulo the radical of the polynomial order. This work provides the first systematic translation of arithmetic structure-via MED representations-into restrictive constraints on the minimum distance, revealing that the Singleton bound may be unattainable not because of linear limitations, but due to underlying algebraic obstructions."}

This paper focuses on selective prediction, which allows DNNs to make informed decisions about when to predict or abstain based on the uncertainty level of their predictions. Current methods are either ad-hoc such as SelectiveNet, focusing on how to modify the network architecture or objective function, or post-hoc such as softmax response, achieving selective prediction through analyzing the model's probabilistic outputs. We observe that post-hoc methods implicitly generate uncertainty information, termed the selective prior, which has traditionally been used only during inference. We argue that the selective prior provided by the selection mechanism is equally vital during the training stage. Therefore, we propose the SYNC loss which introduces a novel integration of ad-hoc and post-hoc method. Specifically, our approach incorporates the softmax response into the training process of SelectiveNet, enhancing its selective prediction capabilities by examining the selective prior. Evaluated across various datasets, including CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100, and Stanford Cars, our method not only enhances the model's generalization capabilities but also surpasses previous works in selective prediction performance, and sets new benchmarks for state-of-the-art performance."}

The central challenge is to reap the benefits of data-sharing while preventing free-riding that would otherwise lead agents to under invest in data collection. We introduce a simple fair-exchange contract in which, for every pair of agents, each agent receives exactly as many data points as it provides, equal to the minimum of their two collection levels. We show that the game induced by this contract is supermodular under a transformation of the strategy space. This results in a clean structure: pure Nash equilibria exist, they form a lattice, and can be computed in time quadratic in the number of agents. In addition, the maximal equilibrium is truthfully implementable under natural enforcement assumptions and is globally Pareto-optimal across all strategy profiles. In a graph-restricted variant of the model supermodularity fails, but an adaptation of the construction still yields efficiently computable pure Nash equilibria and Pareto-optimal outcomes. Overall, fair exchange provides a tractable and incentive-aligned mechanism for data exchange in the absence of payments."}

(Linear) minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimators provide a compelling alternative that can circumvent these limitations. In this work, we study synthetic two-dimensional blind deconvolution problems under fully controlled conditions, with complete prior knowledge of both the signal and kernel distributions. We compare tailored MAP algorithms with simple LMMSE estimators whose functional form is closely related to that of an optimal Tikhonov estimator. Our results show that, even in these highly controlled settings, MAP methods remain unstable and require extensive parameter tuning, whereas the LMMSE estimator yields a robust and reliable baseline. Moreover, we demonstrate empirically that the LMMSE solution can serve as an effective initialization for MAP approaches, improving their performance and reducing sensitivity to regularization parameters, thereby opening the door to future theoretical and practical developments."}

We introduce RECOM (Reddit Evaluation for Correspondence of Models), a benchmark dataset of 15,000 recent Reddit questions from September 2025 paired with community-derived reference answers. We investigate how four open-source LLMs (Llama3.1-8B, Mistral-7B, Gemma-2-9B, and GPT-OSS-20B) respond to these questions, evaluating alignment using lexical metrics (BLEU, ROUGE), semantic similarity (BERTScore, MoverScore, cosine similarity), and logical inference (NLI). Our central finding is a striking semantic-lexical paradox: all models achieve over 99% cosine similarity with references despite less than 8% BLEU-1 overlap, a 90+ percentage point gap indicating that models preserve meaning through extensive paraphrasing rather than lexical reproduction. MoverScore (51-53%) confirms this pattern, occupying an intermediate position that reflects the optimal transport cost of semantic alignment. Furthermore, model scale does not predict performance: Mistral-7B (7B parameters) outperforms GPT-OSS-20B (20B parameters) across all metrics. NLI analysis reveals that contradiction rates remain below 7%, suggesting models rarely generate content that directly conflicts with human consensus. These findings challenge the reliability of lexical metrics for evaluating abstractive generation and argue for multi-dimensional evaluation frameworks that capture semantic fidelity beyond surface-level text matching.

One Figure", "summary": "Enterprises are rapidly deploying large language models, retrieval augmented generation pipelines, and tool using agents into production, often on shared high performance computing clusters and cloud accelerator platforms that also support defensive analytics. These systems increasingly function not as isolated models but as AI estates: socio technical systems spanning models, agents, data pipelines, security tooling, human workflows, and hyperscale infrastructure. Existing governance and security frameworks, including the NIST AI Risk Management Framework and systems security engineering guidance, articulate principles and risk functions but do not provide implementable architectures for multi agent, AI enabled cyber defense.\n  This paper introduces the Practitioners Blueprint for Secure AI (PBSAI) Governance Ecosystem, a multi agent reference architecture for securing enterprise and hyperscale AI estates. PBSAI organizes responsibilities into a twelve domain taxonomy and defines bounded agent families that mediate between tools and policy through shared context envelopes and structured output contracts. The architecture assumes baseline enterprise security capabilities and encodes key systems security techniques, including analytic monitoring, coordinated defense, and adaptive response. A lightweight formal model of agents, context envelopes, and ecosystem level invariants clarifies the traceability, provenance, and human in the loop guarantees enforced across domains. We demonstrate alignment with NIST AI RMF functions and illustrate application in enterprise SOC and hyperscale defensive environments. PBSAI is proposed as a structured, evidence centric foundation for open ecosystem development and future empirical validation."}

Our work bridges this gap by integrating learned depth priors directly into the VINS-Mono optimization backend. We propose a novel framework that enforces affine-invariant depth consistency and pairwise ordinal constraints, explicitly filtering unstable artifacts via variance-based gating. This approach strictly adheres to the computational limits of edge devices while robustly recovering metric scale.

Existing data-driven agent-based models--from rule-based to deep learning--struggle in low-data environments, limiting their practicality. This paper investigates whether large language models, pre-trained on broad human knowledge, can fill this gap by reasoning about everyday activities from compact contextual cues. We adopt a retrieval-augmented prompting strategy that integrates four sources of context--temporal, spatial, behavioral history, and persona--and evaluate it on the CASAS Aruba smart-home dataset. The evaluation spans two complementary tasks: next-activity prediction with duration estimation, and multi-step daily sequence generation, each tested with various numbers of few-shot examples provided in the prompt. Analyzing few-shot effects reveals how much contextual supervision is sufficient to balance data efficiency and predictive accuracy, particularly in low-data environments. Results show that large language models exhibit strong inherent temporal understanding of human behavior: even in zero-shot settings, they produce coherent daily activity predictions, while adding one or two demonstrations further refines duration calibration and categorical accuracy. Beyond a few examples, performance saturates, indicating diminishing returns. Sequence-level evaluation confirms consistent temporal alignment across few-shot conditions. These findings suggest that pre-trained language models can serve as promising temporal reasoners, capturing both recurring routines and context-dependent behavioral variations, thereby strengthening the behavioral modules of agent-based models."}

Closed-form CRB expressions are derived for two representative detection formulations, namely covariance-oriented and coherent models. Moreover, for single-antenna FASs, we obtain a closed-form coherent CRB by leveraging random matrix theory. The results demonstrate that CRB-based analysis provides a tractable and informative benchmark for evaluating activity detection across architectures and detection schemes, and further reveal that FASs can deliver strong spatial-diversity gains with significantly reduced complexity."}

For each model, we evaluate performance using seven unsupervised hallucination detection methods spanning three complementary approaches: semantic consistency based detectors, confidence based detectors, and entropy based detectors. This multifaceted evaluation enables us to characterize how PEFT reshapes uncertainty across different detection paradigms. In conclusion, our experimental results show that PEFT consistently strengthens hallucination detection ability, substantially improving AUROC across a wide range of hallucination detectors. Besides, further analyses using linear probes and representation diagnostics indicate that PEFT methods primarily reshapes how uncertainty is encoded and surfaced, comparing with injecting new factual knowledge into the models."}

Our identification phase captured 30,897 records, which were refined via a tiered keyword filtration schema to a high-recall corpus of 3,042 records for manual screening, resulting in a final included corpus of 346 papers for qualitative synthesis. Our reflexive thematic analysis reveals that systemic failures in positional legibility, combined with the recent architectural shift toward human-as-verifier models, specifically the reliance on model-mediated annotations, introduce deep-seated anchoring bias and effectively remove human voices from the loop. We further demonstrate how geographic hegemony imposes Western norms as universal benchmarks, often enforced by the performative alignment of precarious data workers who prioritize requester compliance over honest subjectivity to avoid economic penalties. Critiquing the \"noisy sensor\" fallacy, where statistical models misdiagnose cultural pluralism as random error, we argue for reclaiming disagreement as a high-fidelity signal essential for building culturally competent models. To address these systemic tensions, we propose a roadmap for pluralistic annotation infrastructures that shift the objective from discovering a singular \"right\" answer to mapping the diversity of human experience."}

It is typically quantified using the Age of Information (AoI) metric, which has been widely adopted to capture the freshness of information received in the form of status updates. While AoI-based metrics quantify how timely the collected information is, they largely overlook the environmental impact associated with frequent transmissions, specifically, the resulting Carbon Footprint (CF). To address this gap, we introduce a carbon-aware AoI framework. We first derive closed-form expressions for the average AoI under constrained CF budgets for the baseline $M/M/1$ and $M/M/1^*$ queuing models, assuming fixed Carbon Intensity (CI). We then extend the analysis by treating CI as a dynamic, time-varying parameter and solve the AoI minimization problem. Our results show that minimizing AoI does not inherently minimize CF, highlighting a clear trade-off between information freshness and environmental impact. CI variability further affects achievable AoI, indicating that sustainable operation requires joint optimization of CF budgets, Signal-to-noise Ratio (SNR), and transmission scheduling. This work lays the foundation for carbon-aware information freshness optimization in next-generation networks."}

Recent progress in auto prompt optimization (APO) offers a more efficient alternative by automatically improving the instructions that guide LLM judges. However, existing APO methods primarily target text-only evaluations and remain underexplored in multimodal settings. In this work, we study auto prompt optimization for multimodal LLM-as-a-judge, particularly for evaluating AI-generated images. We identify a key bottleneck: multimodal models can only process a limited number of visual examples due to context window constraints, which hinders effective trial-and-error prompt refinement. To overcome this, we propose BLPO, a bi-level prompt optimization framework that converts images into textual representations while preserving evaluation-relevant visual cues. Our bi-level optimization approach jointly refines the judge prompt and the I2T prompt to maintain fidelity under limited context budgets.

While allocations satisfying each of these notions individually are known to exist even for general monotone valuations, whether both can be satisfied simultaneously remains open for all instances in which the EFX problem is itself unresolved.\n  In this work, we show that there always exists an allocation that is both EF1 (in fact, the stronger notion EFL) and EEFX for additive valuations, thereby resolving the primary open question raised by Akrami and Rathi (2025) and bringing us one step closer to resolving the elusive EFX problem.

The focus of this paper is to enhance the classification of text according to the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by collecting and combining intelligence from multiple models. Combinatorial Fusion Analysis (CFA), a system fusion paradigm using a rank-score characteristic (RSC) function and cognitive diversity (CD), has been used to enhance classifier methods by combining a set of relatively good and mutually diverse classification models. We use a generative AI model to generate synthetic data for model training and then apply CFA to this classification task.

Our focus is on investigating first-order gradient-based algorithms and their variations, such as the block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm, for tackling this problem. We introduce a set of conditions, called the $n$-sided PL condition, which extends the well-established gradient dominance condition a.k.a Polyak-Łojasiewicz (PL) condition and the concept of multi-convexity. This condition, satisfied by various classes of non-convex functions, allows us to analyze the convergence of various gradient descent (GD) algorithms.

Studying Pythia-family models, we discover a striking cross-over dissociation: angular perturbations cause up to 42.9 more damage to language modeling loss, while magnitude perturbations cause disproportionately more damage to syntactic processing (20.4% vs.1.6% accuracy drop on subject-verb agreement).This finding is enabled by L2-matched perturbation analysis, a methodology ensuring that an gular and magnitude perturbations achieve identical Euclidean displacements. Causal intervention reveals that angular damage flows substantially through the attention pathways (28.4% loss recovery via attention repair), while magnitude damage flows partly through the LayerNorm pathways(29.9% recovery via LayerNorm repair). These patterns replicate across scales within the Pythia architecture family. These findings provide evidence that direction and magnitude support partially distinct computational roles in LayerNorm based architectures. The direction preferentially affects attentional routing, while magnitude modulates processing intensity for fine-grained syntactic judgments. We find different patterns in RMSNorm-based architectures, suggesting that the dissociation depends on architectural choices.

To address this, we develop learning dynamics that achieve fast convergence while being both scale-free, requiring no prior information about utilities, and scale-invariant, remaining unchanged under positive rescaling of utilities. For two-player zero-sum games, we obtain scale-free and scale-invariant dynamics with external regret bounded by $\\tilde{O}(A_{\\mathrm{diff}})$, where $A_{\\mathrm{diff}}$ is the payoff range, which implies an $\\tilde{O}(A_{\\mathrm{diff}} / T)$ convergence rate to Nash equilibrium after $T$ rounds.

Existing benchmarks focus primarily on the computational aspect of this task, testing agents' ability to reproduce or replicate research outcomes when having access to the code and data. This setting, while foundational, (1) fails to capture the inconsistent availability of new data for replication as opposed to reproduction, and (2) lacks ground-truth diversity by focusing only on reproducible papers, thereby failing to evaluate an agent's ability to identify non-replicable research. Furthermore, most benchmarks only evaluate outcomes rather than the replication process. In response, we introduce ReplicatorBench, an end-to-end benchmark, including human-verified replicable and non-replicable research claims in social and behavioral sciences for evaluating AI agents in research replication across three stages: (1) extraction and retrieval of replication data; (2) design and execution of computational experiments; and (3) interpretation of results, allowing a test of AI agents' capability to mimic the activities of human replicators in real world. To set a baseline of AI agents' capability, we develop ReplicatorAgent, an agentic framework equipped with necessary tools, like web search and iterative interaction with sandboxed environments, to accomplish tasks in ReplicatorBench. We evaluate ReplicatorAgent across four underlying large language models (LLMs), as well as different design choices of programming language and levels of code access.

Geometry-based approaches offer precise control but require explicit 3D reconstruction and generalize poorly; diffusion-based methods generalize better but lack fine-grained geometric control. We present Ctrl&Shift, an end-to-end diffusion framework to achieve geometry-consistent object manipulation without explicit 3D representations. Our key insight is to decompose manipulation into two stages, object removal and reference-guided inpainting under explicit camera pose control, and encode both within a unified diffusion process. To enable precise, disentangled control, we design a multi-task, multi-stage training strategy that separates background, identity, and pose signals across tasks. To improve generalization, we introduce a scalable real-world dataset construction pipeline that generates paired image and video samples with estimated relative camera poses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Ctrl&Shift achieves state-of-the-art results in fidelity, viewpoint consistency, and controllability. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to unify fine-grained geometric control and real-world generalization for object manipulation, without relying on any explicit 3D modeling."}

We fully characterize the equilibrium behavior of shortlisted contestants for any given prize structure and shortlist size. We examine two objective functions: the highest individual performance and total performance. For both objectives, the optimal contest is in a winner-take-all format. For the highest individual performance, the optimal shortlist size is exactly two contestants, but, in contrast, for total performance, the shortlist size does not affect the outcome, i.e., any size yields the same total performance.

Although LoRA makes fine-tuning efficient, it is highly sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters, and exhaustive hyperparameter search is still computationally very demanding. To address these challenges, we propose a framework that integrates the domain knowledge of pre-trained LLMs into Bayesian Optimization (BO) to efficiently search for LoRA hyperparameters. To leverage the informed knowledge of LLMs, we repurpose LLMs as a discrete-to-continuous mapping to link the hyperparameters and their domain knowledge with a continuous vector space, where BO is conducted. We design and control the mapping by language prompting, where we provide a domain-aware textual prompt describing the relationships among hyperparameters and their respective roles; thereby, we explicitly inject domain knowledge about LoRA into the LLM in natural language. Also, we model the residual information that is hard to linguistically describe in the prompt with an additional learnable token. This aids BO to sample more high-performing hyperparameters. In addition, by leveraging the observation of the strong correlation between the respective performance obtained from full and subset training datasets in LoRA training regimes, we introduce proxy training and evaluation with a data subset. This further increases the efficiency of our method. We demonstrate that our hyperparameter found with only about 30 iterations achieves more than 20% performance improvement over standard hyperparameters found from about 45,000 combinations."}

In addition, ULF DTI scans exhibit artifacting that spans both the space and angular domains, requiring a custom modelling algorithm for subsequent correction. We introduce a nine-direction, single-shell ULF DTI sequence, as well as a companion Bayesian bias field correction algorithm that possesses angular dependence and convolutional neural network-based superresolution algorithm that is generalizable across DTI datasets and does not require re-training (''DiffSR'').

Unfortunately, for regular distributions, adding $m$ additional buyers is sometimes indeed necessary, so the \"competition complexity\" of the VCG auction is $m$. We seek proving better competition complexity results in two dimensions.\n  First, under stronger distributional assumptions, the competition complexity of VCG auction drops dramatically. In balanced markets (where $m=n$) with MHR distributions, it is sufficient to only add $(e^{1/e} - 1 + o(1))n \\approx 0.4447n$ additional buyers to match the optimal revenue -- less than half the number that is necessary under regularity -- and this bound is asymptotically tight. We provide both exact finite-market results for small value of $n$, and closed-form asymptotic formulas for general market with any $m\\leq n$, and any target fraction of the optimal revenue.\n  Second, we analyze a supply-limiting variant of VCG auction that caps the number of units sold in a prior-independent way.

Gossiping enables local information exchange in a decentralized manner without relying solely on the transmitter's direct communication, which we assume incurs a transmission cost. On the other hand, gossiping may be communicating stale information, necessitating the transmitter's intervention. With communication links having specific success probabilities, we formulate an average-cost Markov Decision Process (MDP) to jointly minimize the sum AoI and transmission cost for such a system in a time-slotted setting. We employ the Relative Value Iteration (RVI) algorithm to evaluate the optimal policy for the transmitter and then prove several structural properties showing that it has an age-difference threshold structure with minimum age activation in the case where gossiping is relatively more reliable. Specifically, direct transmission is optimal only if the minimum AoI of the receivers is large enough and their age difference is below a certain threshold.

Existing methods often suffer from blurred boundaries and inadequate temporal modeling, limiting segmentation accuracy. To address these issues, we propose a Dual-Branch Framework for Semantic Change Detection with Boundary and Temporal Awareness, termed DBTANet. Specifically, we utilize a dual-branch Siamese encoder where a frozen SAM branch captures global semantic context and boundary priors, while a ResNet34 branch provides local spatial details, ensuring complementary feature representations. On this basis, we design a Bidirectional Temporal Awareness Module (BTAM) to aggregate multi-scale features and capture temporal dependencies in a symmetric manner. Furthermore, a Gaussian-smoothed Projection Module (GSPM) refines shallow SAM features, suppressing noise while enhancing edge information for boundary-aware constraints. Extensive experiments on two public benchmarks demonstrate that DBTANet effectively integrates global semantics, local details, temporal reasoning, and boundary awareness, achieving state-of-the-art performance."}

We study the Pareto frontier of the set of seller-buyers ex-ante utilities, generated by all truthful mechanisms when buyers values are sampled independently and identically (i.i.d.). We first provide a complete structural characterization of the Pareto frontier under natural distributional assumptions. For example, when valuations are drawn i.i.d. from a distribution that is both regular and anti-MHR, every Pareto-optimal mechanism is a second-price auction with a reserve no larger than the monopoly reserve.\n  Building on this, we interpret the problem of picking a mechanism as a two-sided bargaining game, and analyze two canonical Pareto-optimal solutions from cooperative bargaining theory: the Kalai-Smorodinsky (KS) solution, and the Nash solution. We prove that when values are drawn i.i.d. from a distribution that is both regular and anti-MHR, in large markets both solutions yield near-optimal welfare. In contrast, under worst-case MHR distributions, their performance diverges sharply: the KS solution guarantees one-half of the optimal welfare, while the Nash solution might only achieve an arbitrarily small fraction of it. These results highlight the sensitivity of fairness-efficiency tradeoffs to distributional structure, and affirm the KS solution as the more robust notion of fairness for asymmetric two-sided markets."}

While existing methods typically rely on dedicated models for achieving specific compression ratios, they are often limited in flexibility and generalization. In particular, retraining is necessary when adapting to a new compression ratio. To address this limitation, we propose a novel and flexible Arbitrary Ratio Feature Compression (ARFC) framework, which supports any compression ratio with a single model, eliminating the need for multiple specialized models. At its core, the Arbitrary Ratio Compressor (ARC) is an auto-regressive model that performs compression via next-token prediction. This allows the compression ratio to be controlled at inference simply by adjusting the number of generated tokens. To enhance the quality of the compressed features, two key modules are introduced. The Mixture of Solutions (MoS) module refines the compressed tokens by utilizing multiple compression results (solutions), reducing uncertainty and improving robustness. The Entity Relation Graph Constraint (ERGC) is integrated into the training process to preserve semantic and structural relationships during compression. Extensive experiments on cross-modal retrieval, image classification, and image retrieval tasks across multiple datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches at various compression ratios. Notably, in some cases, it even surpasses the performance of the original, uncompressed features. These results validate the effectiveness and versatility of ARFC for practical, resource-constrained scenarios."}

Each game, presented in randomized order, grants \\textit{access to} a single LLM assistance modality: proactive recommendations from an \\textit{Advisor}, reactive feedback from a \\textit{Coach}, or autonomous execution by a \\textit{Delegate}; all modalities are powered by an underlying LLM that achieves superhuman performance in an all-agent environment. On each turn, participants privately decide whether to act manually or use the AI modality available in that game. Despite preferring the \\textit{Advisor} modality, participants achieve the highest mean individual gains with the \\textit{Delegate}, demonstrating a preference-performance misalignment. Moreover, delegation generates positive externalities; even non-adopting users in \\textit{access-to-delegate} treatment groups benefit by receiving higher-quality offers. Mechanism analysis reveals that the \\textit{Delegate} agent acts as a market maker, injecting rational, Pareto-improving proposals that restructure the trading environment. Our research reveals a gap between agent capabilities and realized group welfare.

Traditional compression techniques, such as dictionary-based and statistical methods, often struggle to optimally exploit the structure and redundancy in complex data formats. Recent advancements in deep learning have opened new avenues for compression; however, many existing approaches depend on dense vector representations that obscure the underlying token structure. To address these limitations, we propose a novel lossless compression method that leverages Reinforcement Learning applied to a T5 language model architecture. This approach enables the compression of data into sequences of tokens rather than traditional vector representations. Unlike auto-encoders, which typically encode information into continuous latent spaces, our method preserves the token-based structure, aligning more closely with the original data format. This preservation allows for higher compression ratios while maintaining semantic integrity. By training the model using an off-policy Reinforcement Learning algorithm, we optimize sequence length to minimize redundancy and enhance compression efficiency. Our method introduces an efficient and adaptive data compression system built upon advanced Reinforcement Learning techniques, functioning independently of external grammatical or world knowledge. This approach shows significant improvements in compression ratios compared to conventional methods. By leveraging the latent information within language models, our system effectively compresses data without requiring explicit content understanding, paving the way for more robust and practical compression solutions across various applications."}

We address this gap by introducing Distributionally robust IGM (DrIGM), a principle that requires each agent's robust greedy action to align with the robust team-optimal joint action. We show that DrIGM holds for a novel definition of robust individual action values, which is compatible with decentralized greedy execution and yields a provable robustness guarantee for the whole system. Building on this foundation, we derive DrIGM-compliant robust variants of existing value-factorization architectures (e.g., VDN/QMIX/QTRAN) that (i) train on robust Q-targets, (ii) preserve scalability, and (iii) integrate seamlessly with existing codebases without bespoke per-agent reward shaping.

While the principal can theoretically extract the full social welfare using a discriminatory contract that tailors payments to individual costs, such contracts may be perceived as unfair. In this work, we introduce and analyze anonymous contracts, where payments depend solely on the total number of successes, ensuring identical treatment of agents.\n  We first establish that every anonymous contract admits a pure Nash equilibrium. However, because general anonymous contracts can suffer from multiple equilibria with unbounded gaps in principal utility, we identify uniform anonymous contracts as a desirable subclass. We prove that uniform anonymous contracts guarantee a unique equilibrium, thereby providing robust performance guarantees.\n  In terms of efficiency, we prove that under limited liability, anonymous contracts cannot generally approximate the social welfare better than a factor logarithmic in the spread of agent success probabilities. We show that uniform contracts are sufficient to match this theoretical limit. Finally, we demonstrate that removing limited liability significantly boosts performance: anonymous contracts generally achieve an $O(\\log n)$ approximation to the social welfare and, surprisingly, can extract the full welfare whenever agents' success probabilities are distinct. This reveals a structural reversal: widely spread probabilities are the hardest case under limited liability, whereas identical probabilities become the hardest case when limited liability is removed."}

We explore multimodal RLVR through the lens of cross-modal attention connectivity and find that only a small fraction of tokens (approximately 15%) exhibit strong visual-textual coupling. These high-connectivity tokens act as anchors that ground reasoning in the image, while the majority follow linguistic patterns. During RLVR training, credit assignment naturally concentrates on these anchors, sharpening their visual grounding over time. Building on this insight, we propose Anchor-Token Reinforcement Learning (AT-RL), a lightweight framework that selectively reinforces high-connectivity tokens via graph-based clustering of attention topology. Evaluated across the series (3B-32B), AT-RL introduces only 1.2% overhead yet enables the 32B model to surpass the 72B-Instruct baseline on MathVista (80.2), with consistent gains observed across STEM, video and general tasks. Conversely, training solely on low-connectivity tokens causes severe degradation, confirming that effective multimodal RL hinges on precise credit assignment to visual anchors.

To bridge this gap, we introduce a vascular anatomy-aware masked image modeling (VasoMIM) framework that explicitly integrates domain-specific anatomical knowledge. Specifically, VasoMIM comprises two key designs: an anatomy-guided masking strategy and an anatomical consistency loss. The former strategically masks vessel-containing patches to compel the model to learn robust vascular semantics, while the latter preserves structural consistency of vessels between original and reconstructed images, enhancing the discriminability of the learned representations.

In this work, we address these gaps for an extension of cMGs, which we term General Utility Markov Games (GUMGs), capturing new applications requiring coupling between agents' occupancy measures. We prove that in GUMGs, Nash equilibria coincide with the fixed points of projected pseudo-gradient dynamics (i.e., first-order stationary points), enabled by a novel agent-wise gradient domination property. This insight also yields a simple proof of NE existence using Brouwer's fixed-point theorem. We further show the existence of Markov perfect equilibria. Building on this characterization, we establish a policy gradient theorem for GUMGs and design a model-free policy gradient algorithm. For potential GUMGs, we establish iteration complexity guarantees for computing approximate-NE under exact gradients and provide sample complexity bounds in both the generative model and on-policy settings.

This paper investigates whether large language models, pre-trained on broad human knowledge, can fill this gap by reasoning about everyday activities from compact contextual cues. We adopt a retrieval-augmented prompting strategy that integrates four sources of context--temporal, spatial, behavioral history, and persona--and evaluate it on the CASAS Aruba smart-home dataset. The evaluation spans two complementary tasks: next-activity prediction with duration estimation, and multi-step daily sequence generation, each tested with various numbers of few-shot examples provided in the prompt. Analyzing few-shot effects reveals how much contextual supervision is sufficient to balance data efficiency and predictive accuracy, particularly in low-data environments. Results show that large language models exhibit strong inherent temporal understanding of human behavior: even in zero-shot settings, they produce coherent daily activity predictions, while adding one or two demonstrations further refines duration calibration and categorical accuracy. Beyond a few examples, performance saturates, indicating diminishing returns. Sequence-level evaluation confirms consistent temporal alignment across few-shot conditions. These findings suggest that pre-trained language models can serve as promising temporal reasoners, capturing both recurring routines and context-dependent behavioral variations, thereby strengthening the behavioral modules of agent-based models."}

We introduce AgentLeak, to the best of our knowledge the first full-stack benchmark for privacy leakage covering internal channels, spanning 1,000 scenarios across healthcare, finance, legal, and corporate domains, paired with a 32-class attack taxonomy and three-tier detection pipeline. Testing GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Mistral Large, and Llama 3.3 70B across 4,979 traces reveals that multi-agent configurations reduce per-channel output leakage (C1: 27.2% vs 43.2% in single-agent) but introduce unmonitored internal channels that raise total system exposure to 68.9% (OR-aggregated across C1, C2, C5). Internal channels account for most of this gap: inter-agent messages (C2) leak at 68.8%, compared to 27.2% on C1 (output channel). This means that output-only audits miss 41.7% of violations. Claude 3.5 Sonnet, which emphasizes safety alignment in its design, achieves the lowest leakage rates on both external (3.3%) and internal (28.1%) channels, suggesting that model-level safety training may transfer to internal channel protection. Across all five models and four domains, the pattern C2 > C1 holds consistently, confirming that inter-agent communication is the primary vulnerability.

Efforts to reduce this exposure by lowering the radiotracer dose or scan time can degrade image quality. While using magnetic resonance (MR) images with clearer anatomical information to restore standard-dose PET (SPET) from low-dose PET (LPET) is a promising approach, it faces challenges with the inconsistencies in the structure and texture of multi-modality fusion, as well as the mismatch in out-of-distribution (OOD) data. In this paper, we propose a supervise-assisted multi-modality fusion diffusion model (MFdiff) for addressing these challenges for high-quality PET restoration. Firstly, to fully utilize auxiliary MR images without introducing extraneous details in the restored image, a multi-modality feature fusion module is designed to learn an optimized fusion feature. Secondly, using the fusion feature as an additional condition, high-quality SPET images are iteratively generated based on the diffusion model. Furthermore, we introduce a two-stage supervise-assisted learning strategy that harnesses both generalized priors from simulated in-distribution datasets and specific priors tailored to in-vivo OOD data. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed MFdiff effectively restores high-quality SPET images from multi-modality inputs and outperforms state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively."}

Participants, therefore, conduct a limited number of interviews, which provide early, noisy impressions and shape final decisions. We study bandit learning in matching markets with interviews, modeling interviews as \\textit{low-cost hints} that reveal partial preference information to both sides. Our framework departs from existing work by allowing firm-side uncertainty: firms, like agents, may be unsure of their own preferences and can make early hiring mistakes by hiring less preferred agents. To handle this, we extend the firm's action space to allow \\emph{strategic deferral} (choosing not to hire in a round), enabling recovery from suboptimal hires and supporting decentralized learning without coordination. We design novel algorithms for (i) a centralized setting with an omniscient interview allocator and (ii) decentralized settings with two types of firm-side feedback. Across all settings, our algorithms achieve time-independent regret, a substantial improvement over the $O(\\log T)$ regret bounds known for learning stable matchings without interviews. Also, under mild structured markets, decentralized performance matches the centralized counterpart up to polynomial factors in the number of agents and firms."}

In this work, we fine-tune an LLM for AD detection and investigate how task-relevant information is encoded within its internal representations. We employ probing techniques to analyze intermediate activations across transformer layers, and we observe that, after fine-tuning, the probing values of specific words and special markers change substantially, indicating that these elements assume a crucial role in the model's improved detection performance. Guided by this insight, we design a curated set of task-aware special markers and train a sequence-to-sequence model as a data-synthesis tool that leverages these markers to generate structurally consistent and diagnostically informative synthetic samples.

However, most existing approaches primarily emphasize learning task-specific outputs or static knowledge representations, while overlooking the continuous refinement of internal reasoning structures, action scheduling policies, and learning mechanisms themselves. In this paper, we propose a human-inspired continuous learning framework that unifies reasoning, action, reflection, and verification within a sequential reasoning model enhanced by parallel learning. The framework explicitly treats internal thinking processes as primary learning objects. It systematically records internal reasoning trajectories and environmental interactions as structured learning material, enabling the system to optimize not only task-level content but also the organization, scheduling, and evolution of reasoning activities. This design realizes learning alongside processing, allowing cognitive structures to improve during execution. Furthermore, the framework supports controlled replacement of predefined logic with learned procedures and introduces a hierarchical learning-to-learn mechanism that jointly adapts task-level parameters and learning strategies. As a result, the system progressively evolves its internal cognitive architecture while preserving operational stability. Experimental results on a temperature sensor abnormality detection task show that incorporating internal-process learning reduces average runtime by 23.9%."}

Two complementary instantiations are introduced: (i) a conditional Wasserstein GAN (WGAN)-based compression denoiser that explicitly controls the rate-distortion-perception (RDP) trade-off, and (ii) a conditional diffusion-based reconstruction strategy that performs iterative denoising guided by compressed latents.

This study proposes SemaPop, a semantic-statistical population synthesis model that integrates large language models (LLMs) with generative population modeling. SemaPop derives high-level persona representations from individual survey records and incorporates them as semantic conditioning signals for population generation, while marginal regularization is introduced to enforce alignment with target population marginals.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that SemaPop-GAN achieves improved generative performance, yielding closer alignment with target marginal and joint distributions while maintaining sample-level feasibility and diversity under semantic conditioning. Ablation studies further confirm the contribution of semantic persona conditioning and architectural design choices to balancing marginal consistency and structural realism. These results demonstrate that SemaPop-GAN enables controllable and interpretable population synthesis through effective semantic-statistical information fusion. SemaPop-GAN also provides a promising modular foundation for developing generative population projection systems that integrate individual-level behavioral semantics with population-level statistical constraints."}

By integrating Computer Vision (CV) and Deep Learning (DL), vision-based SHM can automatically identify and localize visual patterns associated with structural damage. However, previous works typically generate only discrete outputs, such as damage class labels and damage region coordinates, requiring engineers to further reorganize and analyze these results for evaluation and decision-making. In late 2022, Large Language Models (LLMs) became popular across multiple fields, providing new insights into AI-aided vision-based SHM. In this study, a novel LLM-based Disaster Reconnaissance Summarization (LLM-DRS) framework is proposed. It introduces a standard reconnaissance plan in which the collection of vision data and corresponding metadata follows a well-designed on-site investigation process. Text-based metadata and image-based vision data are then processed and integrated into a unified format, where well-trained Deep Convolutional Neural Networks extract key attributes, including damage state, material type, and damage level. Finally, all data are fed into an LLM with carefully designed prompts, enabling the LLM-DRS to generate summary reports for individual structures or affected regions based on aggregated attributes and metadata.

This survey reviews multi-agent communication (MA-Comm) through the Five Ws: who communicates with whom, what is communicated, when communication occurs, and why communication is beneficial. This framing offers a clean way to connect ideas across otherwise separate research threads. We trace how communication approaches have evolved across three major paradigms. In Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), early methods used hand-designed or implicit protocols, followed by end-to-end learned communication optimized for reward and control. While successful, these protocols are frequently task-specific and hard to interpret, motivating work on Emergent Language (EL), where agents can develop more structured or symbolic communication through interaction. EL methods, however, still struggle with grounding, generalization, and scalability, which has fueled recent interest in large language models (LLMs) that bring natural language priors for reasoning, planning, and collaboration in more open-ended settings. Across MARL, EL, and LLM-based systems, we highlight how different choices shape communication design, where the main trade-offs lie, and what remains unsolved. We distill practical design patterns and open challenges to support future hybrid systems that combine learning, language, and control for scalable and interpretable multi-agent collaboration."}

Yet existing RL post-training pipelines treat all input signals as equally relevant, ignoring which modalities each task actually requires. This modality-blind training inflates policy-gradient variance, slows convergence, and degrades robustness to real-world distribution shifts where signals may be missing, added, or reweighted. We introduce MAPLE, a complete modality-aware post-training and learning ecosystem comprising: (1) MAPLE-bench, the first benchmark explicitly annotating minimal signal combinations required per task; (2) MAPO, a modality-aware policy optimization framework that stratifies batches by modality requirement to reduce gradient variance from heterogeneous group advantages; (3) Adaptive weighting and curriculum scheduling that balances and prioritizes harder signal combinations. Systematic analysis across loss aggregation, clipping, sampling, and curriculum design establishes MAPO's optimal training strategy. Adaptive weighting and curriculum focused learning further boost performance across signal combinations. MAPLE narrows uni/multi-modal accuracy gaps by 30.24%, converges 3.18x faster, and maintains stability across all modality combinations under realistic reduced signal access. MAPLE constitutes a complete recipe for deployment-ready multimodal RL post-training."}

However, training on the large-scale datasets is computationally expensive and inefficient due to redundancy in the data, which motivates the need for multimodal data selection to improve training efficiency. Existing data selection methods for VIT either require costly training or gradient computation. Training-free alternatives often depend on proxy models or datasets, instruction-agnostic representations, and pairwise similarity with quadratic complexity, limiting scalability and representation fidelity. In this work, we propose ScalSelect, a scalable training-free multimodal data selection method with linear-time complexity with respect to the number of samples, eliminating the need for external models or auxiliary datasets. ScalSelect first constructs sample representations by extracting visual features most attended by instruction tokens in the target VLM, capturing instruction-relevant information. It then identifies samples whose representations best approximate the dominant subspace of the full dataset representations, enabling scalable importance scoring without pairwise comparisons. Extensive experiments across multiple VLMs, datasets, and selection budgets demonstrate that ScalSelect achieves over 97.5% of the performance of training on the full dataset using only 16% of the data, and even outperforms full-data training in some settings.

We propose Normalized Logit Difference Decay (NLDD), a metric that measures whether individual reasoning steps are faithful to the model's decision-making process. Our approach corrupts individual reasoning steps from the explanation and measures how much the model's confidence in its answer drops, to determine if a step is truly important. By standardizing these measurements, NLDD enables rigorous cross-model comparison across different architectures. Testing three model families across syntactic, logical, and arithmetic tasks, we discover a consistent Reasoning Horizon (k*) at 70--85% of chain length, beyond which reasoning tokens have little or negative effect on the final answer. We also find that models can encode correct internal representations while completely failing the task. These results show that accuracy alone does not reveal whether a model actually reasons through its chain. NLDD offers a way to measure when CoT matters."}

Then, we explore the connection between Poisson's equation and physics, e.g., the electrostatic potential due to a positive charge density. We employ Green's functions to obtain a closed-form parametric expression for the PDE's solution, and leverage the linearity of our proxy PDE to find the target shape's implicit field as a superposition of solutions. Our method shows improved results in approximating high-frequency details, even with a small number of shape priors."}

In this work, we investigate the susceptibility and resilience of several ResNet-based architectures, referred to as BrainNet, BrainNeXt and DilationNet, against gradient-based adversarial attacks, namely FGSM and PGD. These models, based on ResNet, ResNeXt, and dilated ResNet variants respectively, are evaluated across three preprocessing configurations (i) full-sized augmented, (ii) shrunk augmented and (iii) shrunk non-augmented MRI datasets. Our experiments reveal that BrainNeXt models exhibit the highest robustness to black-box attacks, likely due to their increased cardinality, though they produce weaker transferable adversarial samples. In contrast, BrainNet and Dilation models are more vulnerable to attacks from each other, especially under PGD with higher iteration steps and $α$ values. Notably, shrunk and non-augmented data significantly reduce model resilience, even when the untampered test accuracy remains high, highlighting a key trade-off between input resolution and adversarial vulnerability.

A common challenge arises from solving the PDE families, which are characterized by sharing an identical mathematical structure but varying in specific parameters. Traditional numerical methods, such as the finite element method, need to independently solve each instance within a PDE family, which incurs massive computational cost. On the other hand, while recent advancements in machine learning PDE solvers offer impressive computational speed and accuracy, their inherent ``black-box\" nature presents a considerable limitation. These methods primarily yield numerical approximations, thereby lacking the crucial interpretability provided by analytical expressions, which are essential for deeper scientific insight. To address these limitations, we propose a neuro-assisted multitasking symbolic PDE solver framework for PDE family solving, dubbed NMIPS. In particular, we employ multifactorial optimization to simultaneously discover the analytical solutions of PDEs. To enhance computational efficiency, we devise an affine transfer method by transferring learned mathematical structures among PDEs in a family, avoiding solving each PDE from scratch.

In this work, we pro-pose a novel GR-Diffusion framework that synergistically integrates the geometric priors of GR with the generative power of diffusion models for 3D low-dose whole-body PET reconstruction. GR-Diffusion employs GR to generate a reference 3D PET image from projection data, establishing a physically grounded and structurally explicit benchmark that overcomes the low-pass limitations of conventional point-based or voxel-based methods. This reference image serves as a dual guide during the diffusion process, ensuring both global consistency and local accuracy. Specifically, we employ a hierarchical guidance mechanism based on the GR reference. Fine-grained guidance leverages differences to refine local details, while coarse-grained guidance uses multi-scale difference maps to correct deviations. This strategy allows the diffusion model to sequentially integrate the strong geometric prior from GR and recover sub-voxel information. Experimental results on the UDPET and Clinical datasets with varying dose levels show that GR-Diffusion outperforms state-of-the-art methods in enhancing 3D whole-body PET image quality and preserving physiological details."}

Furthermore, we pairs prompts with misaligned and aligned responses via two-stage rejection sampling to enforce quality. Second we benchmarks general-purpose, fine-tuned, and open-weight LLMs, enabling systematic evaluation of misalignment under three dimensions.

For safe driving in unexpected scenarios, these systems may additionally rely on human interventions such as natural language instructions. Using a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) facilitates human-vehicle interaction and can improve performance in such scenarios. However, this approach requires substantial computational resources due to its reliance on an LLM and numerous visual tokens from sensor inputs, which are limited in autonomous vehicles. Many MLLM studies have explored reducing visual tokens, but often suffer end-task performance degradation compared to using all tokens.\n  To enable efficient E2E driving while maintaining performance comparable to using all tokens, this paper proposes the first Supervised Token Reduction framework for multi-modal LLMs (SToRM). The proposed framework consists of three key elements. First, a lightweight importance predictor with short-term sliding windows estimates token importance scores. Second, a supervised training approach uses an auxiliary path to obtain pseudo-supervision signals from an all-token LLM pass. Third, an anchor-context merging module partitions tokens into anchors and context tokens, and merges context tokens into relevant anchors to reduce redundancy while minimizing information loss. Experiments on the LangAuto benchmark show that SToRM outperforms state-of-the-art E2E driving MLLMs under the same reduced-token budget, maintaining all-token performance while reducing computational cost by up to 30x."}

Our approach is grounded in established psychological questionnaires but adapts them for LLMs by transforming human self-report statements into Situational Judgment Tests (SJTs). These SJTs assess behavior by eliciting natural recommendations in realistic user-assistant scenarios. We generate 2,500 SJTs, each validated by three human annotators, and collect preferred actions from 10 annotators per SJT, from a large pool of 550 participants. In a comprehensive study involving 25 LLMs, we find that models often do not reflect the distribution of human preferences: (1) in scenarios with low human consensus, LLMs consistently exhibit overconfidence in a single response; (2) when human consensus is high, smaller models deviate significantly, and even some frontier models do not reflect the consensus in 15-20% of cases; (3) traits can exhibit cross-LLM patterns, e.g., LLMs may encourage emotion expression in contexts where human consensus favors composure. Lastly, mapping psychometric statements directly to behavioral scenarios presents a unique opportunity to evaluate the predictive validity of self-reports, revealing considerable gaps between LLMs' stated values and their revealed behavior."}

Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback relies on preference annotations that are prohibitively expensive and often fail to reflect the absolute correctness of medical facts. Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards lacks effective automatic verifiers and struggles to handle complex clinical contexts. Meanwhile, medical alignment requires the simultaneous optimization of correctness, safety, and compliance, yet multi-objective heterogeneous reward signals are prone to scale mismatch and optimization conflicts.To address these challenges, we propose a robust medical alignment paradigm. We first construct a holistic multi-dimensional medical alignment matrix that decomposes alignment objectives into four categories: fundamental capabilities, expert knowledge, online feedback, and format specifications. Within each category, we establish a closed loop of where observable metrics inform attributable diagnosis, which in turn drives optimizable rewards, thereby providing fine-grained, high-resolution supervision signals for subsequent iterative optimization. To resolve gradient domination and optimization instability problem caused by heterogeneous signals, we further propose a unified optimization mechanism. This mechanism employs Reference-Frozen Normalization to align reward scales and implements a Tri-Factor Adaptive Dynamic Weighting strategy to achieve collaborative optimization that is weakness-oriented, risk-prioritized, and redundancy-reducing. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed paradigm in real-world medical scenario evaluations, establishing a new paradigm for complex alignment in vertical domains."}

The direction is orthogonal to the known refusal direction, localised at 6.25% of model depth, and causally influences introspective output when used for steering. When models produce \"loop\" vocabulary, their activations exhibit higher autocorrelation (r = 0.44, p = 0.002); when they produce \"shimmer\" vocabulary under steering, activation variability increases (r = 0.36, p = 0.002). Critically, the same vocabulary in non-self-referential contexts shows no activation correspondence despite nine-fold higher frequency. Qwen 2.5-32B, with no shared training, independently develops different introspective vocabulary tracking different activation metrics, all absent in descriptive controls.

It employs a Symbolic Knowledge Engine that treats simulation setup as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem, rigidly enforcing physical constraints via a Deterministic RAG Engine with specialized retrieval strategies for solvers, turbulence models, and boundary conditions. Validated through rigorous OpenFOAM experiments on practical, non-tutorial CFD tasks using Gemini-2.5-Pro/Flash, PhyNiKCE demonstrates a 96% relative improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, by replacing trial-and-error with knowledge-driven initialization, the framework reduced autonomous self-correction loops by 59% while simultaneously lowering LLM token consumption by 17%.

Its critical application lies in cluttered environments, where occlusions, limited viewpoints, and noisy masks degrade perception. To address these challenges, we present Clutt3R-Seg, a zero-shot pipeline for robust 3D instance segmentation for language-grounded grasping in cluttered scenes. Our key idea is to introduce a hierarchical instance tree of semantic cues. Unlike prior approaches that attempt to refine noisy masks, our method leverages them as informative cues: through cross-view grouping and conditional substitution, the tree suppresses over- and under-segmentation, yielding view-consistent masks and robust 3D instances. Each instance is enriched with open-vocabulary semantic embeddings, enabling accurate target selection from natural language instructions. To handle scene changes during multi-stage tasks, we further introduce a consistency-aware update that preserves instance correspondences from only a single post-interaction image, allowing efficient adaptation without rescanning. Clutt3R-Seg is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world datasets, and validated on a real robot. Across all settings, it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in cluttered and sparse-view scenarios. Even on the most challenging heavy-clutter sequences, Clutt3R-Seg achieves an AP@25 of 61.66, over 2.2x higher than baselines, and with only four input views it surpasses MaskClustering with eight views by more than 2x.

However, their problem-solving ability often declines on more complex tasks due to hallucinations and the accumulation of errors within these intermediate steps. Recent work has introduced the notion of critical tokens--tokens in the reasoning process that exert significant influence on subsequent steps. Prior studies suggest that replacing critical tokens can refine reasoning trajectories. Nonetheless, reliably identifying and exploiting critical tokens remains challenging. To address this, we propose the Paraphrastic Probing and Consistency Verification~(PPCV) framework. PPCV operates in two stages. In the first stage, we roll out an initial reasoning path from the original question and then concatenate paraphrased versions of the question with this reasoning path. And we identify critical tokens based on mismatches between the predicted top-1 token and the expected token in the reasoning path. A criterion is employed to confirm the final critical token. In the second stage, we substitute critical tokens with candidate alternatives and roll out new reasoning paths for both the original and paraphrased questions. The final answer is determined by checking the consistency of outputs across these parallel reasoning processes. We evaluate PPCV on mainstream LLMs across multiple benchmarks. Extensive experiments demonstrate PPCV substantially enhances the reasoning performance of LLMs compared to baselines."}

To bridge this gap, we collect the first dataset for this task, consisting of approximately 4 hours of video collected from 8 participants during everyday activities. We evaluate a transformer-based gaze estimation model, GLC, on the new dataset and propose two extensions: an auxiliary gaze out-of-bound classification task and a multi-view co-learning approach that jointly trains head-view and neck-view models using a geometry-aware auxiliary loss. Experimental results show that incorporating gaze out-of-bound classification improves performance over standard fine-tuning, while the co-learning approach does not yield gains.

We show this pathology has a precise causal origin: autoregressive training provides no gradient signal to distinguish association P(Y|X) from intervention P(Y|do(X)), a failure we formalize as Rung Collapse. When outcome-based learning reinforces correct answers obtained through incorrect causal models, the agent becomes entrenched in flawed reasoning, a phenomenon we term Aleatoric Entrenchment. We propose Epistemic Regret Minimization (ERM), a belief revision objective that penalizes errors in causal reasoning independently of task success, and embed it within a three-layer architecture with three contributions grounded in knowledge representation: (1) a Physical Grounding Theorem proving that actions satisfying actuator independence implement valid do-operations, bridging action languages and do-calculus; (2) ERM as a causal belief revision operator satisfying AGM postulates, preventing entrenchment even when the agent succeeds for the wrong reasons; and (3) a failure mode taxonomy that classifies recurring reasoning errors and injects domain-independent guards, enabling cross-domain transfer. We prove asymptotic recovery of the true interventional distribution with finite-sample bounds. Experiments on 1,360 causal trap scenarios across six frontier LLMs reveal that Rung Collapse persists even in reasoning-enhanced models (3.7% for GPT-5.2), that steerability exhibits inverse scaling where advanced models resist generic correction, and that targeted ERM feedback recovers 53-59% of entrenched errors where outcome-level feedback fails."}

The simulator generates realistic, controllable patient interactions that systematically vary across medical, linguistic, and behavioral dimensions, allowing annotators and an independent AI judge to assess agent performance, identify hallucinations and inaccuracies, and characterize risk patterns across diverse patient populations. Methods: The simulator is grounded in the NIST AI Risk Management Framework and integrates three profile components reflecting different dimensions of patient variation: (1) medical profiles constructed from electronic health records in the All of Us Research Program; (2) linguistic profiles modeling variation in health literacy and condition-specific communication patterns; and (3) behavioral profiles representing empirically observed interaction patterns, including cooperation, distraction, and adversarial engagement. We evaluated the simulator's effectiveness in identifying errors in an AI decision aid for antidepressant selection. Results: We generated 500 conversations between the patient simulator and the AI decision aid across systematic combinations of five linguistic and three behavioral profiles. Human annotators assessed 1,787 medical concepts across 100 conversations, achieving high agreement (F1=0.94, \\k{appa}=0.73), and the LLM judge achieved comparable agreement with human annotators (F1=0.94, \\k{appa}=0.78; paired bootstrap p=0.21).

To address this challenge, we propose RI-Mamba, the first rotation-invariant state-space model for point clouds. RI-Mamba defines global and local reference frames to disentangle pose from geometry and uses Hilbert sorting to construct token sequences with meaningful geometric structure while maintaining rotation invariance. We further introduce a novel strategy to compute orientational embeddings and reintegrate them via feature-wise linear modulation, effectively recovering spatial context and enhancing model expressiveness. Our strategy is inherently compatible with state-space models and operates in linear time. To scale up retrieval, we adopt cross-modal contrastive learning with automated triplet generation, allowing training on diverse datasets without manual annotation.

Existing methods fail to resolve the resulting plasticity--stability dilemma, often suppressing necessary learning signals alongside harmful ones. To address this issue, we unify token-level SFT objectives within a generalized deformed-log family and expose a universal gate $\\times$ error gradient structure, where the gate controls how much the model trusts its current prediction. By employing the Cayley transform, we map the model's continuously evolving uncertainty onto a continuous focus trajectory, which enables seamless interpolation between scenarios involving uncertain novel concepts and those involving well-established knowledge. We then introduce Dynamic Entropy Fine-Tuning (DEFT), a parameter-free objective that modulates the trust gate using distribution concentration (Rényi-2 entropy) as a practical proxy for the model's predictive state. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate that DEFT achieves a better balance between exploration and exploitation, leading to improved overall performance."}

Analysis of model confidence dynamics under latent reasoning reveals that thinking trajectories ending in incorrect answers contain fewer low-confidence steps than those ending in correct answers.

Motivated by these observations, ThinkRouter, an inference-time confidence-aware routing mechanism is proposed to avoid high confidence and noise for efficient reasoning. ThinkRouter routes thinking to the discrete token space when model confidence is low, and to the latent space otherwise. Extensive experiments on STEM reasoning and coding benchmarks across diverse large reasoning models demonstrate that ThinkRouter outperforms explicit CoT, random routing, and latent reasoning baselines in terms of accuracy, achieving an average improvement of 19.70 points in Pass@1, while reducing generation length by up to 15.55%. Further comprehensive analysis reveals that ThinkRouter can calibrate errors arising from explicit CoT and latent reasoning, and accelerates end-of-thinking token generation by globally lowering model confidence."}

In this work, we propose Sparse Complementary Fusion with reverse KL (SCF-RKL), a novel model merging framework that explicitly controls functional interference through sparse, distribution-aware updates. Instead of assuming linear additivity in parameter space, SCF-RKL measures the functional divergence between models using reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence and selectively incorporates complementary parameters. This mode-seeking, sparsity-inducing design effectively preserves stable representations while integrating new capabilities. We evaluate SCF-RKL across a wide range of model scales and architectures, covering both reasoning-focused and instruction-tuned models.

We introduce LoopFormer, a looped Transformer trained on variable-length trajectories to enable budget-conditioned reasoning. Our core contribution is a shortcut-consistency training scheme that aligns trajectories of different lengths, ensuring that shorter loops yield informative representations while longer loops continue to refine them. LoopFormer conditions each loop on the current time and step size, enabling representations to evolve consistently across trajectories of varying length rather than drifting or stagnating. Empirically, LoopFormer demonstrates robust performance on language modeling and reasoning benchmarks even under aggressive compute constraints, while scaling gracefully with additional budget. These results show that looped Transformers are inherently suited for adaptive language modeling, opening a path toward controllable and budget-aware large language models."}

Recent approaches using Large Language Models (LLMs) for 3D scene generation show promise but often lack domain-specific reasoning, verification mechanisms, and modular design. These limitations lead to reduced control and poor scalability. This paper investigates the use of LLMs to generate agricultural synthetic simulation environments from natural language prompts, specifically to address the limitations of lacking domain-specific reasoning, verification mechanisms, and modular design. A modular multi-LLM pipeline was developed, integrating 3D asset retrieval, domain knowledge injection, and code generation for the Unreal rendering engine using its API. This results in a 3D environment with realistic planting layouts and environmental context, all based on the input prompt and the domain knowledge. To enhance accuracy and scalability, the system employs a hybrid strategy combining LLM optimization techniques such as few-shot prompting, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), finetuning, and validation. Unlike monolithic models, the modular architecture enables structured data handling, intermediate verification, and flexible expansion. The system was evaluated using structured prompts and semantic accuracy metrics. A user study assessed realism and familiarity against real-world images, while an expert comparison demonstrated significant time savings over manual scene design. The results confirm the effectiveness of multi-LLM pipelines in automating domain-specific 3D scene generation with improved reliability and precision. Future work will explore expanding the asset hierarchy, incorporating real-time generation, and adapting the pipeline to other simulation domains beyond agriculture."}

We evaluated 33 state-of-the-art LLMs on the proposed ADRD-Bench. Results showed that the accuracy of open-weight general models ranged from 0.63 to 0.93 (mean: 0.78; std: 0.09). The accuracy of open-weight medical models ranged from 0.48 to 0.93 (mean: 0.82; std: 0.13). The accuracy of closed-source general models ranged from 0.83 to 0.91 (mean: 0.89; std: 0.03). While top-tier models achieved high accuracies (>0.9), case studies revealed that inconsistent reasoning quality and stability limit their reliability, highlighting a critical need for domain-specific improvement to enhance LLMs' knowledge and reasoning grounded in daily caregiving data. The entire dataset is available at https://github.com/IIRL-ND/ADRD-Bench."}

Despite recent progress, existing datasets are often limited in domain coverage, supported graph query languages, or evaluation scope. The advancement of Text-to-GQL systems is hindered by the lack of high-quality benchmark datasets and evaluation methods to systematically compare model capabilities across different graph query languages and domains. In this work, we present Text2GQL-Bench, a unified Text-to-GQL benchmark designed to address these limitations. Text2GQL-Bench couples a multi-GQL dataset that has 178,184 (Question, Query) pairs spanning 13 domains, with a scalable construction framework that generates datasets in different domains, question abstraction levels, and GQLs with heterogeneous resources. To support compre-hensive assessment, we introduce an evaluation method that goes beyond a single end-to-end metric by jointly reporting grammatical validity, similarity, semantic alignment, and execution accuracy. Our evaluation uncovers a stark dialect gap in ISO-GQL generation: even strong LLMs achieve only at most 4% execution accuracy (EX) in zero-shot settings, though a fixed 3-shot prompt raises accuracy to around 50%, the grammatical validity remains lower than 70%. Moreover, a fine-tuned 8B open-weight model reaches 45.1% EX, and 90.8% grammatical validity, demonstrating that most of the performance jump is unlocked by exposure to sufficient ISO-GQL examples."}

A fine-tuning ablation provides interventional evidence: training only the audio projection layer increases text dominance (+26.5\\%), while LoRA on the language model halves it ($-$23.9\\%), localizing text dominance to the LLM's reasoning rather than the audio encoder.

AIR defines a domain-specific language for managing the incident response lifecycle autonomously in LLM agent systems, and integrates it into the agent's execution loop to (1) detect incidents via semantic checks grounded in the current environment state and recent context, (2) guide the agent to execute containment and recovery actions via its tools, and (3) synthesize guardrail rules during eradication to block similar incidents in future executions. We evaluate AIR on three representative agent types. Results show that AIR achieves detection, remediation, and eradication success rates all exceeding 90%. Extensive experiments further confirm the necessity of AIR's key design components, show the timeliness and moderate overhead of AIR, and demonstrate that LLM-generated rules can approach the effectiveness of developer-authored rules across domains. These results show that incident response is both feasible and essential as a first-class mechanism for improving agent safety."}

In this work, we propose a novel visual prompting paradigm that avoids the difficult problem of aligning coordinates across modalities. Specifically, we reformulate per-frame coordinate prediction as a compact instance-level identification problem by assigning each object a unique, temporally consistent ID. These IDs are embedded into the video as visual prompts, providing explicit and interpretable inputs to the VLMs. Furthermore, we introduce STVG-R1, the first reinforcement learning framework for STVG, which employs a task-driven reward to jointly optimize temporal accuracy, spatial consistency, and structural format regularization. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. STVG-R1 surpasses the baseline Qwen2.5-VL-7B by a remarkable margin of 20.9% on m_IoU on the HCSTVG-v2 benchmark, establishing a new state of the art (SOTA).

We introduce MuRGAt (Multimodal Reasoning with Grounded Attribution), a benchmark for evaluating fact-level multimodal attribution in settings that require reasoning beyond direct observation. Given inputs spanning video, audio, and other modalities, MuRGAt requires models to generate answers with explicit reasoning and precise citations, where each citation specifies both modality and temporal segments. To enable reliable assessment, we introduce an automatic evaluation framework that strongly correlates with human judgments. Benchmarking with human and automated scores reveals that even strong MLLMs frequently hallucinate citations despite correct reasoning. Moreover, we observe a key trade-off: increasing reasoning depth or enforcing structured grounding often degrades accuracy, highlighting a significant gap between internal reasoning and verifiable attribution."}

We propose TSR (Trajectory-Search Rollouts), a training-time approach that repurposes test-time scaling ideas for improved per-turn rollout generation. TSR performs lightweight tree-style search to construct high-quality trajectories by selecting high-scoring actions at each turn using task-specific feedback. This improves rollout quality and stabilizes learning while leaving the underlying optimization objective unchanged, making TSR optimizer-agnostic. We instantiate TSR with best-of-N, beam, and shallow lookahead search, and pair it with PPO and GRPO, achieving up to 15% performance gains and more stable learning on Sokoban, FrozenLake, and WebShop tasks at a one-time increase in training compute. By moving search from inference time to the rollout stage of training, TSR provides a simple and general mechanism for stronger multi-turn agent learning, complementary to existing frameworks and rejection-sampling-style selection methods."}

In this work, we propose SParse Expert Synchronization (SPES), a memory-efficient decentralized framework for pretraining mixture-of-experts (MoE) LLMs. SPES trains only a subset of experts per node, substantially lowering the memory footprint. Each node updates its local experts and periodically synchronizes with other nodes, eliminating full-parameter transmission while ensuring efficient knowledge sharing.

MaxExp requires no calibration data and is flexible across several scores. We also introduce the Set Size Expectation (SSE) method, a computationally efficient alternative that predicts assemblages based on expected species richness. Using three case studies spanning diverse taxa, species counts, and performance metrics, we show that MaxExp consistently matches or surpasses widely used thresholding and calibration methods, especially under strong class imbalance and high rarity.

To address this issue, we notably find and demonstrate that Tsallis Entropy (TE), a generalized form of SE, is naturally suited for characterizing biased distributions by introducing a non-extensive parameter q, with the performance of SE serving as a lower bound for TE. Building upon this, we generalize TE into Adaptive Debiasing Tsallis Entropy (ADTE) for TTA, customizing a class-specific parameter q^l derived by normalizing the estimated label bias from continuously incoming test instances, for each category. This adaptive approach allows ADTE to accurately select high-confidence views and seamlessly integrate with a label adjustment strategy to enhance adaptation, without introducing distribution-specific hyperparameter tuning. Besides, our investigation reveals that both TE and ADTE can serve as direct, advanced alternatives to SE in TTA, without any other modifications. Experimental results show that ADTE outperforms state-of-the-art methods on ImageNet and its five variants, and achieves the highest average performance on 10 cross-domain benchmarks, regardless of the model architecture or text prompts used.

Inspired by the concept of selective attention in the human brain, we introduce a memory discrimination task. To address large-scale interactions and diverse memory standards in this task, we propose a Scene-Aware Memory Discrimination method (SAMD), which comprises two key components: the Gating Unit Module (GUM) and the Cluster Prompting Module (CPM). GUM enhances processing efficiency by filtering out non-memorable interactions and focusing on the salient content most relevant to application demands. CPM establishes adaptive memory standards, guiding LLMs to discern what information should be remembered or discarded. It also analyzes the relationship between user intents and memory contexts to build effective clustering prompts. Comprehensive direct and indirect evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our approach. We independently assess the performance of memory discrimination, showing that SAMD successfully recalls the majority of memorable data and remains robust in dynamic scenarios. Furthermore, when integrated into personalized applications, SAMD significantly enhances both the efficiency and quality of memory construction, leading to better organization of personal knowledge."}

The LAVES formulates educational video generation as a multi-objective task that simultaneously demands correct step-by-step reasoning, pedagogically coherent narration, semantically faithful visual demonstrations, and precise audio--visual alignment. To address the limitations of prior approaches--including low procedural fidelity, high production cost, and limited controllability--LAVES decomposes the generation workflow into specialized agents coordinated by a central Orchestrating Agent with explicit quality gates and iterative critique mechanisms. Specifically, the Orchestrating Agent supervises a Solution Agent for rigorous problem solving, an Illustration Agent that produces executable visualization codes, and a Narration Agent for learner-oriented instructional scripts. In addition, all outputs from the working agents are subject to semantic critique, rule-based constraints, and tool-based compilation checks. Rather than directly synthesizing pixels, the system constructs a structured executable video script that is deterministically compiled into synchronized visuals and narration using template-driven assembly rules, enabling fully automated end-to-end production without manual editing. In large-scale deployments, LAVES achieves a throughput exceeding one million videos per day, delivering over a 95% reduction in cost compared to current industry-standard approaches while maintaining a high acceptance rate."}

In this work, we propose Light4D, a novel training-free framework designed to synthesize consistent 4D videos under target illumination, even under extreme viewpoint changes. First, we introduce Disentangled Flow Guidance, a time-aware strategy that effectively injects lighting control into the latent space while preserving geometric integrity. Second, to reinforce temporal consistency, we develop Temporal Consistent Attention within the IC-Light architecture and further incorporate deterministic regularization to eliminate appearance flickering.

We show that RLVR induces a distinctive behavioral signature: prompts encountered during RLVR training result in more rigid and similar generations, while unseen prompts retain greater diversity. We introduce Min-$k$NN Distance, a simple black-box detector that quantifies this collapse by sampling multiple completions for a given prompt and computing the average of the $k$ smallest nearest-neighbor edit distances. Min-$k$NN Distance requires no access to the reference model or token probabilities. Experiments across multiple RLVR-trained reasoning models show that Min-$k$NN Distance reliably distinguishes RL-seen examples from unseen ones and outperforms existing membership inference and RL contamination detection baselines."}

Semantic ID-based approaches effectively discretize this information into compact tokens. However, two challenges persist: (1) Suboptimal Tokenization: existing methods (e.g., RQ-VAE) lack disentanglement between shared cross-modal semantics and modality-specific details, causing redundancy or collapse; (2) Architecture-Data Mismatch: vanilla Transformers treat semantic IDs as flat streams, ignoring the hierarchy of user interactions, items, and tokens. Expanding items into multiple tokens amplifies length and noise, biasing attention toward local details over holistic semantics. We propose Hi-SAM, a Hierarchical Structure-Aware Multi-modal framework with two designs: (1) Disentangled Semantic Tokenizer (DST): unifies modalities via geometry-aware alignment and quantizes them via a coarse-to-fine strategy. Shared codebooks distill consensus while modality-specific ones recover nuances from residuals, enforced by mutual information minimization; (2) Hierarchical Memory-Anchor Transformer (HMAT): splits positional encoding into inter- and intra-item subspaces via Hierarchical RoPE to restore hierarchy. It inserts Anchor Tokens to condense items into compact memory, retaining details for the current item while accessing history only through compressed summaries. Experiments on real-world datasets show consistent improvements over SOTA baselines, especially in cold-start scenarios.

One such synthetic data generation method is Formula Driven Supervised Learning (FDSL), which can provide an infinite number of perfectly labeled data through a formula driven approach, such as fractals or contours. FDSL does not have common drawbacks like manual labor, privacy and other ethical concerns. In this work we generate 3D fractals using 3D Iterated Function Systems (IFS) for pre-training an action recognition model. The fractals are temporally transformed to form a video that is used as a pre-training dataset for downstream task of action recognition. We find that standard methods of generating fractals are slow and produce degenerate 3D fractals. Therefore, we systematically explore alternative ways of generating fractals and finds that overly-restrictive approaches, while generating aesthetically pleasing fractals, are detrimental for downstream task performance. We propose a novel method, Targeted Smart Filtering, to address both the generation speed and fractal diversity issue. The method reports roughly 100 times faster sampling speed and achieves superior downstream performance against other 3D fractal filtering methods."}

Moreover, existing frequency-based approaches impose identical spectral regularization across channels under a homogeneity assumption, which leads to uneven regularization strength under the inter-variable spectral heterogeneity in multivariate meteorological data. To address these challenges, we propose a 3D Masked AutoEncoder (3D-MAE) that encodes weather-state evolution features as an additional conditioning for the diffusion model, together with a Variable-Aware Masked Frequency Modeling (VA-MFM) strategy that adaptively selects thresholds based on the spectral energy distribution of each variable. Together, we propose PuYun-LDM, which enhances latent diffusability and achieves superior performance to ENS at short lead times while remaining comparable to ENS at longer horizons. PuYun-LDM generates a 15-day global forecast with a 6-hour temporal resolution in five minutes on a single NVIDIA H200 GPU, while ensemble forecasts can be efficiently produced in parallel."}

This paper argues that these limitations are closely tied to an overlooked component, pretrained visual representation, which offers insufficient knowledge on both aspects of environment understanding and policy prior. Through an in-depth analysis, we find that commonly used visual representations in VLAs, whether pretrained via language-image contrastive learning or image-based self-supervised learning, remain inadequate at capturing crucial, task-relevant environment information and at inducing effective policy priors, i.e., anticipatory knowledge of how the environment evolves under successful task execution. In contrast, we discover that predictive embeddings pretrained on videos, in particular V-JEPA 2, are adept at flexibly discarding unpredictable environment factors and encoding task-relevant temporal dynamics, thereby effectively compensating for key shortcomings of existing visual representations in VLAs. Building on these observations, we introduce JEPA-VLA, a simple yet effective approach that adaptively integrates predictive embeddings into existing VLAs. Our experiments demonstrate that JEPA-VLA yields substantial performance gains across a range of benchmarks, including LIBERO, LIBERO-plus, RoboTwin2.0, and real-robot tasks."}

In this paper, we answer both questions by collecting sensicality judgments from human raters and LLMs on sentences from five semantically deviant datasets: both context-free and when providing a context. We find that raters consider most sentences at most anomalous, and only a few as properly nonsensical.

We introduce a lightweight framework that reuses the main model's internal hidden states for efficient length prediction. Our framework features two core components: 1) Entropy-Guided Token Pooling (EGTP), which uses on-the-fly activations and token entropy for highly accurate static prediction with negligible cost, and 2) Progressive Length Prediction (PLP), which dynamically estimates the remaining length at each decoding step to handle stochastic generation. To validate our approach, we build and release ForeLen, a comprehensive benchmark with long-sequence, Chain-of-Thought, and RL data. On ForeLen, EGTP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, reducing MAE by 29.16\\% over the best baseline.

Guided by the axiom that Parsing is Reasoning, we introduce Thinking with Drafting (TwD), which utilizes a minimalist Domain-Specific Language (DSL) as a grounding intermediate representation. Unlike standard approaches that hallucinate answers directly, TwD forces the model to draft its mental model into executable code, rendering deterministic visual proofs for self-verification.

However, existing inversion methods, such as vanilla RF-based inversion, suffer from approximation errors that accumulate across timesteps, leading to unstable velocity fields and degraded reconstruction and editing quality. To address this challenge, we propose Proximal-Mean Inversion (PMI), a training-free gradient correction method that stabilizes the velocity field by guiding it toward a running average of past velocities, constrained within a theoretically derived spherical Gaussian.

Furthermore, while autoregressive LMs can output explicit reasoning, their true reasoning process is opaque, which introduces risks like deception and hallucination. In this work, we introduce the Prototype Transformer (ProtoT) -- an autoregressive LM architecture based on prototypes (parameter vectors), posed as an alternative to the standard self-attention-based transformers. ProtoT works by means of two-way communication between the input sequence and the prototypes, and we show that this leads to the prototypes automatically capturing nameable concepts (e.g. \"woman\") during training. They provide the potential to interpret the model's reasoning and allow for targeted edits of its behavior. Furthermore, by design, the prototypes create communication channels that aggregate contextual information at different time scales, aiding interpretability. In terms of computation scalability, ProtoT scales linearly with sequence length vs the quadratic scalability of SOTA self-attention transformers. Compared to baselines, ProtoT scales well with model and data size, and performs well on text generation and downstream tasks (GLUE). ProtoT exhibits robustness to input perturbations on par or better than some baselines, but differs from them by providing interpretable pathways showing how robustness and sensitivity arises. Reaching close to the performance of state-of-the-art architectures, ProtoT paves the way to creating well-performing autoregressive LMs interpretable by design."}

To address this, we propose Region-to-Image Distillation, which transforms zooming from an inference-time tool into a training-time primitive, thereby internalizing the benefits of agentic zooming into a single forward pass of an MLLM. In particular, we first zoom in to micro-cropped regions to let strong teacher models generate high-quality VQA data, and then distill this region-grounded supervision back to the full image. After training on such data, the smaller student model improves \"single-glance\" fine-grained perception without tool use.

Under review", "summary": "Dynamic maps (DM) serve as the fundamental information infrastructure for vehicle-road-cloud (VRC) cooperative autonomous driving in China and Japan. By providing comprehensive traffic scene representations, DM overcome the limitations of standalone autonomous driving systems (ADS), such as physical occlusions. Although DM-enhanced ADS have been successfully deployed in real-world applications in Japan, existing DM systems still lack a natural-language-supported (NLS) human interface, which could substantially enhance human-DM interaction. To address this gap, this paper introduces VRCsim, a VRC cooperative perception (CP) simulation framework designed to generate streaming VRC-CP data. Based on VRCsim, we construct a question-answering data set, VRC-QA, focused on spatial querying and reasoning in mixed-traffic scenes. Building upon VRCsim and VRC-QA, we further propose Talk2DM, a plug-and-play module that extends VRC-DM systems with NLS querying and commonsense reasoning capabilities. Talk2DM is built upon a novel chain-of-prompt (CoP) mechanism that progressively integrates human-defined rules with the commonsense knowledge of large language models (LLMs). Experiments on VRC-QA show that Talk2DM can seamlessly switch across different LLMs while maintaining high NLS query accuracy, demonstrating strong generalization capability. Although larger models tend to achieve higher accuracy, they incur significant efficiency degradation. Our results reveal that Talk2DM, powered by Qwen3:8B, Gemma3:27B, and GPT-oss models, achieves over 93\\% NLS query accuracy with an average response time of only 2-5 seconds, indicating strong practical potential."}

This limits their effectiveness in generating realistic samples for place recognition tasks. To address these challenges, we propose DiffPlace, a novel framework that introduces a place-ID controller to enable place-controllable multi-view image generation. The place-ID controller employs linear projection, perceiver transformer, and contrastive learning to map place-ID embeddings into a fixed CLIP space, allowing the model to synthesize images with consistent background buildings while flexibly modifying foreground objects and weather conditions. Extensive experiments, including quantitative comparisons and augmented training evaluations, demonstrate that DiffPlace outperforms existing methods in both generation quality and training support for visual place recognition.

Using a large corpus of Luxembourgish user comments, the approach uncovers extensive lexical and orthographic variation that aligns with patterns described in dialectal and sociolinguistic research. The induced families capture systematic correspondences and highlight areas of regional and stylistic differentiation. The procedure does not strictly require manual annotation, but does produce transparent clusters that support both quantitative and qualitative analysis. The results demonstrate that distributional modelling can reveal meaningful patterns of variation even in ''noisy'' or low-resource settings, offering a reproducible methodological framework for studying language variety in multilingual and small-language contexts."}

In recent years, several ring artifact reduction solutions have been proposed in the image domain or in the sinogram domain using supervised deep learning methods. However, these methods require dedicated datasets for training, leading to a high data collection cost. Furthermore, existing approaches focus exclusively on either image-space or sinogram-space correction, neglecting the intrinsic correlations from the forward operation of the CT geometry. Based on the theoretical analysis of non-ideal CT detector responses, the RAR problem is reformulated as an inverse problem by using an unrolled network, which considers non-ideal response together with linear forward-projection with CT geometry. Additionally, the intrinsic correlations of ring artifacts between the sinogram and image domains are leveraged through synthetic data derived from natural images, enabling the trained model to correct artifacts without requiring real-world clinical data. Extensive evaluations on diverse scanning geometries and anatomical regions demonstrate that the model trained on synthetic data consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods."}

Extracting this signal typically relies on metrics such as perplexity, which do not adequately account for context; how one should interpret a given next-token probability is dependent on the number of reasonable choices encoded by the shape of the conditional distribution. In this work, we present DMAP, a mathematically grounded method that maps a text, via a language model, to a set of samples in the unit interval that jointly encode rank and probability information. This representation enables efficient, model-agnostic analysis and supports a range of applications. We illustrate its utility through three case studies: (i) validation of generation parameters to ensure data integrity, (ii) examining the role of probability curvature in machine-generated text detection, and (iii) a forensic analysis revealing statistical fingerprints left in downstream models that have been subject to post-training on synthetic data.

To capture this, we propose the Hierarchical Sparse Autoencoder (HSAE), which jointly learns a series of SAEs and the parent-child relationships between their features. HSAE strengthens the alignment between parent and child features through two novel mechanisms: a structural constraint loss and a random feature perturbation mechanism. Extensive experiments across various LLMs and layers demonstrate that HSAE consistently recovers semantically meaningful hierarchies, supported by both qualitative case studies and rigorous quantitative metrics. At the same time, HSAE preserves the reconstruction fidelity and interpretability of standard SAEs across different dictionary sizes.

Selective Abstraction for Reliable Long-Form Text Generation", "comment": null, "summary": "LLMs are widely used, yet they remain prone to factual errors that erode user trust and limit adoption in high-risk settings. One approach to mitigate this risk is to equip models with uncertainty estimation mechanisms that abstain when confidence is low. However, this binary \"all-or-nothing\" approach is excessively restrictive in long-form settings, often discarding valuable information. We introduce Selective Abstraction (SA), a framework that enables LLMs to trade specificity for reliability by selectively reducing the detail of uncertain content. We first formalize SA through the lenses of selective risk and coverage. We then propose Atom-wise Selective Abstraction, a claim-level instantiation that decomposes responses into atomic claims (short, self-contained statements each expressing a single fact) and replaces uncertain atoms with higher confidence, less specific abstractions. To evaluate this framework, we develop a novel end-to-end pipeline for open-ended generation that instantiates risk as factual correctness and measures coverage using an information-theoretic measure of retained information. Across six open-source models on the FactScore and LongFact-Objects benchmarks, atom-wise SA consistently outperforms existing baselines, improving the area under the risk-coverage curve (AURC) by up to 27.73% over claim removal, demonstrating that reducing specificity can boost accuracy and reliability while preserving most of their original meaning."}

Our approach first trains INRs to capture continuous spatial representations of LGE data and associated myocardium and fibrosis masks. These INRs are then compressed into compact latent embeddings, preserving essential anatomical information. A diffusion model operates on this latent space to generate new representations, which are decoded into synthetic LGE images with anatomically consistent segmentation masks. Experiments on 133 cardiac MRI scans suggest that augmenting training data with 200 synthetic volumes contributes to improved fibrosis segmentation performance, with the Dice score showing an increase from 0.509 to 0.524.

Existing automated methods primarily follow two paradigms: Decoupled Factor Generation, which treats factor discovery as isolated events, and Iterative Factor Evolution, which focuses on local parent-child refinements. However, both paradigms lack a global structural view, often treating factor pools as unstructured collections or fragmented chains, which leads to redundant search and limited diversity. To address these limitations, we introduce AlphaPROBE (Alpha Mining via Principled Retrieval and On-graph Biased Evolution), a framework that reframes alpha mining as the strategic navigation of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). By modeling factors as nodes and evolutionary links as edges, AlphaPROBE treats the factor pool as a dynamic, interconnected ecosystem. The framework consists of two core components: a Bayesian Factor Retriever that identifies high-potential seeds by balancing exploitation and exploration through a posterior probability model, and a DAG-aware Factor Generator that leverages the full ancestral trace of factors to produce context-aware, nonredundant optimizations. Extensive experiments on three major Chinese stock market datasets against 8 competitive baselines demonstrate that AlphaPROBE significantly gains enhanced performance in predictive accuracy, return stability and training efficiency. Our results confirm that leveraging global evolutionary topology is essential for efficient and robust automated alpha discovery.

These discrepancies suggest distinct error profiles for different LLMs. When such models are used for scientific data annotation and inference, their hidden disagreements propagate into research results: in re-analyses of published studies in education and political science, switching the annotation model can change estimated treatment effects by more than 80%, and in some cases reverses their sign.

In this paper, we propose a Logic-Oriented perspective, modeling the financial market as a dynamic, evolutionary ecosystem of competing investment narratives, termed Modes of Thought. To operationalize this view, we introduce MEME (Modeling the Evolutionary Modes of Financial Markets), designed to reconstruct market dynamics through the lens of evolving logics.

To model semantic drift among different market conditions, we also implement a temporal evaluation and alignment mechanism to track the lifecycle and historical profitability of these modes. By prioritizing enduring market wisdom over transient anomalies, MEME ensures that portfolio construction is guided by robust reasoning. Extensive experiments on three heterogeneous Chinese stock pools from 2023 to 2025 demonstrate that MEME consistently outperforms seven SOTA baselines.

Although deep learning models have demonstrated significant accuracy, they frequently suffer from miscalibration, manifested as overconfidence in erroneous predictions. To facilitate clinical acceptance, it is imperative that models quantify uncertainty in a manner that correlates with prediction correctness, allowing clinicians to identify unreliable outputs for further review. In order to address this necessity, the present paper proposes a generalizable probabilistic optimization framework grounded in Bayesian deep learning. Specifically, a novel Confidence-Uncertainty Boundary Loss (CUB-Loss) is introduced that imposes penalties on high-certainty errors and low-certainty correct predictions, explicitly enforcing alignment between prediction correctness and uncertainty estimates. Complementing this training-time optimization, a Dual Temperature Scaling (DTS) strategy is devised for post-hoc calibration, further refining the posterior distribution to improve intuitive explainability. The proposed framework is validated on three distinct medical imaging tasks: automatic screening of pneumonia, diabetic retinopathy detection, and identification of skin lesions. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves consistent calibration improvements across diverse modalities, maintains robust performance in data-scarce scenarios, and remains effective on severely imbalanced datasets, underscoring its potential for real clinical deployment."}

Extensive experiments across four language pairs demonstrate that CMRT improves adversarial robustness by an average of more than 3 BLEU points, establishing a new baseline for robust E2E-ST without the overhead of generating adversarial speech."}

Evaluating the quality and clinical reliability of these generated images is essential. However, existing methods mainly assess image realism or diversity, while failing to capture whether the generated images reflect the intended clinical semantics, such as anatomical location and pathology. In this study, we propose the Clinical Semantics Evaluator (CSEval), a framework that leverages language models to assess clinical semantic alignment between the generated images and their conditioning prompts. Our experiments show that CSEval identifies semantic inconsistencies overlooked by other metrics and correlates with expert judgment. CSEval provides a scalable and clinically meaningful complement to existing evaluation methods, supporting the safe adoption of generative models in healthcare."}

Previous work using 3D-CNNs and Vision Transformers (ViT) has shown promising results in detecting key activities from newborn resuscitation videos, but also highlighted the challenges in recognizing such fine-grained activities. This work investigates the potential of generative AI (GenAI) methods to improve activity recognition from such videos. Specifically, we explore the use of local vision-language models (VLMs), combined with large language models (LLMs), and compare them to a supervised TimeSFormer baseline. Using a simulated dataset comprising 13.26 hours of newborn resuscitation videos, we evaluate several zero-shot VLM-based strategies and fine-tuned VLMs with classification heads, including Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Our results suggest that small (local) VLMs struggle with hallucinations, but when fine-tuned with LoRA, the results reach F1 score at 0.91, surpassing the TimeSformer results of 0.70."}

We argue that this gap is partly due to underspecified questions - queries whose interpretation cannot be uniquely determined without additional context. To test this hypothesis, we introduce an LLM-based classifier to identify underspecified questions and apply it to several widely used QA datasets, finding that 16% to over 50% of benchmark questions are underspecified and that LLMs perform significantly worse on them. To isolate the effect of underspecification, we conduct a controlled rewriting experiment that serves as an upper-bound analysis, rewriting underspecified questions into fully specified variants while holding gold answers fixed. QA performance consistently improves under this setting, indicating that many apparent QA failures stem from question underspecification rather than model limitations. Our findings highlight underspecification as an important confound in QA evaluation and motivate greater attention to question clarity in benchmark design."}

While recent studies have exploited behavior-related prompts adjustment to enhance reasoning, these designs remain largely intuitive and lack a systematic analysis of the underlying behavioral patterns. Motivated by this, we investigate how models' reasoning behaviors shape reasoning from the perspective of behavioral patterns. We observe that models exhibit adaptive distributions of reasoning behaviors when responding to specific types of questions, and that structurally injecting these patterns can substantially influence the quality of the models' reasoning processes and outcomes. Building on these findings, we propose two optimization methods that require no parameter updates: InjectCorrect and InjectRLOpt. InjectCorrect guides the model by imitating behavioral patterns derived from its own past correct answers. InjectRLOpt learns a value function from historical behavior-pattern data and, via our proposed Reliability-Aware Softmax Policy, generates behavioral injectant during inference to steer the reasoning process. Our experiments demonstrate that both methods can improve model performance across various reasoning tasks without requiring any modifications to model parameters, achieving gains of up to 5.34% and 8.67%, respectively."}

However, the extent to which LLMs adapt to different social contexts is largely unknown. As these models increasingly mediate human-to-human communication, their failure to adapt to diverse styles can perpetuate stereotypes and marginalize communities whose linguistic norms are less closely mirrored by the models, thereby reinforcing social stratification. We study the extent to which LLMs integrate into social media communication across different socioeconomic status (SES) communities. We collect a novel dataset from Reddit and YouTube, stratified by SES. We prompt four LLMs with incomplete text from that corpus and compare the LLM-generated completions to the originals along 94 sociolinguistic metrics, including syntactic, rhetorical, and lexical features. LLMs modulate their style with respect to SES to only a minor extent, often resulting in approximation or caricature, and tend to emulate the style of upper SES more effectively.

We propose DTAPP-IICR: a Delivery-Time Aware Prioritized Planning method with Incremental and Iterative Conflict Resolution. Our framework first generates an initial solution by prioritizing missions based on urgency. Secondly, it computes roundtrip trajectories using SFIPP-ST, a novel 4D single-agent planner (Safe Flight Interval Path Planning with Soft and Temporal Constraints). SFIPP-ST handles heterogeneous UAVs, strictly enforces temporal NFZs, and models inter-agent conflicts as soft constraints. Subsequently, an iterative Large Neighborhood Search, guided by a geometric conflict graph, efficiently resolves any residual conflicts. A completeness-preserving directional pruning technique further accelerates the 3D search. On benchmarks with temporal NFZs, DTAPP-IICR achieves near-100% success with fleets of up to 1,000 UAVs and gains up to 50% runtime reduction from pruning, outperforming batch Enhanced Conflict-Based Search in the UTM context. Scaling successfully in realistic city-scale operations where other priority-based methods fail even at moderate deployments, DTAPP-IICR is positioned as a practical and scalable solution for preflight planning in dense, dynamic urban airspace."}

High dynamic range (HDR) imaging above 120 dB is essential in these contexts. Conventional CCD/CMOS sensors, with dynamic ranges typically below 70 dB, are highly susceptible to saturation under glare, resulting in irreversible loss of detail and significant errors in digital image correlation (DIC). Methods This paper presents an HDR imaging system that leverages the spatial modulation capability of a digital micromirror device (DMD). The system architecture enables autonomous regional segmentation and adaptive exposure control for high-dynamic-range scenes through an integrated framework comprising two synergistic subsystems: a DMD-based optical modulation unit and an adaptive computational imaging pipeline. Results The system achieves a measurable dynamic range of 127 dB, effectively eliminating satu ration artifacts under high glare. Experimental results demonstrate a 78% reduction in strain error and improved DIC positioning accuracy, confirming reliable performance across extreme intensity variations. Conclusion The DMD-based system provides high fidelity adaptive HDR imaging, overcoming key limitations of conventional sensors. It exhibits strong potential for optical metrology and stress analysis in high-glare environments where traditional methods are inadequate."}

This raises a natural question about operator choice: Mamba-2's state space recurrence is itself a form of iterative refinement, making it a natural candidate for recursive reasoning -- but does introducing Mamba-2 into the recursive scaffold preserve reasoning capability? We investigate this by replacing the Transformer blocks in TRM with Mamba-2 hybrid operators while maintaining parameter parity (6.83M vs 6.86M parameters). On ARC-AGI-1, we find that the hybrid improves pass@2 (the official metric) by +2.0\\% (45.88\\% vs 43.88\\%) and consistently outperforms at higher K values (+4.75\\% at pass@100), whilst maintaining pass@1 parity. This suggests improved candidate coverage -- the model generates correct solutions more reliably -- with similar top-1 selection. Our results validate that Mamba-2 hybrid operators preserve reasoning capability within the recursive scaffold, establishing SSM-based operators as viable candidates in the recursive operator design space and taking a first step towards understanding the best mixing strategies for recursive reasoning."}

Especially the capacity of Small Language Models (SLMs) is limited, leading to factually incorrect generations. This problem is often mitigated by giving the SLM access to an outside source: the ability to query a larger model, documents, or a database. Under this setting, we study the fundamental question of \\emph{which tokens an SLM can and should learn} during pretraining, versus \\emph{which ones it should delegate} via a \\texttt{<CALL>} token. We find that this is not simply a question of loss: although the loss is predictive of whether a predicted token mismatches the ground-truth, some tokens are \\emph{acceptable} in that they are truthful alternative continuations of a pretraining document, and should not trigger a \\texttt{<CALL>} even if their loss is high. We find that a spaCy grammar parser can help augment the loss signal to decide which tokens the SLM should learn to delegate to prevent factual errors and which are safe to learn and predict even under high losses. We propose LaCy, a novel pretraining method based on this token selection philosophy. Our experiments demonstrate that LaCy models successfully learn which tokens to predict and where to delegate for help.

We introduce StateLM, a new class of foundation models endowed with an internal reasoning loop to manage their own state. We equip our model with a suite of memory tools, such as context pruning, document indexing, and note-taking, and train it to actively manage these tools. By learning to dynamically engineering its own context, our model breaks free from the architectural prison of a fixed window.

We propose CLUES, a framework that models Text-to-SQL as a two-stage process (interpretations --> answers) and decomposes semantic uncertainty into an ambiguity score and an instability score. The instability score is computed via the Schur complement of a bipartite semantic graph matrix. Across AmbigQA/SituatedQA (gold interpretations) and a clinical Text-to-SQL benchmark (known interpretations), CLUES improves failure prediction over state-of-the-art Kernel Language Entropy. In deployment settings, it remains competitive while providing a diagnostic decomposition unavailable from a single score. The resulting uncertainty regimes map to targeted interventions - query refinement for ambiguity, model improvement for instability. The high-ambiguity/high-instability regime contains 51% of errors while covering 25% of queries, enabling efficient triage."}

However, they often generate over-long chains-of-thought that, driven by substantial reflections such as repetitive self-questioning and circular reasoning, lead to high token consumption, substantial computational overhead, and increased latency without improving accuracy, particularly in smaller models. Our observation reveals that increasing problem complexity induces more excessive and unnecessary reflection, which in turn reduces accuracy and increases token overhead. To address this challenge, we propose Adaptive Reflection and Length Coordinated Penalty (ARLCP), a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to dynamically balance reasoning efficiency and solution accuracy. ARLCP introduces two key innovations: (1) a reflection penalty that adaptively curtails unnecessary reflective steps while preserving essential reasoning, and (2) a length penalty calibrated to the estimated complexity of the problem. By coordinating these penalties, ARLCP encourages the model to generate more concise and effective reasoning paths. We evaluate our method on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks using DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B models. Experimental results show that ARLCP achieves a superior efficiency-accuracy trade-off compared to existing approaches. For the 1.5B model, it reduces the average response length by 53.1% while simultaneously improving accuracy by 5.8%. For the 7B model, it achieves a 35.0% reduction in length with a 2.7% accuracy gain. The code is released at https://github.com/ZeweiYu1/ARLCP ."}

Existing representations either rely on UV maps, which suffer from distortion during unwrapping, or point-based methods, which tightly couple texture fidelity to geometric density that limits high-resolution texture generation. To address these limitations, we introduce TexSpot, a diffusion-based texture enhancement framework. At its core is Texlet, a novel 3D texture representation that merges the geometric expressiveness of point-based 3D textures with the compactness of UV-based representation. Each Texlet latent vector encodes a local texture patch via a 2D encoder and is further aggregated using a 3D encoder to incorporate global shape context. A cascaded 3D-to-2D decoder reconstructs high-quality texture patches, enabling the Texlet space learning. Leveraging this representation, we train a diffusion transformer conditioned on Texlets to refine and enhance textures produced by multi-view diffusion methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TexSpot significantly improves visual fidelity, geometric consistency, and robustness over existing state-of-the-art 3D texture generation and enhancement approaches.

To mitigate this, we propose Composition-RL, a simple yet useful approach for better utilizing limited verifiable prompts targeting pass-rate-1 prompts.

Furthermore, we devise a Multi-Task Progressive Training scheme that leverages weakly-constrained generative priors to regularize strongly-constrained tasks, preventing overfitting and harmonizing disparate objectives. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DreamID-Omni achieves comprehensive state-of-the-art performance across video, audio, and audio-visual consistency, even outperforming leading proprietary commercial models.

Meanwhile, safety diagnosis often drifts from concrete risk scenarios and remains at the explainable level. In this way, safety alignment lack dedicated explanations of changes in internal mechanisms, potentially degrading general capabilities. To systematically address these issues, we propose an open-source project, namely DeepSight, to practice a new safety evaluation-diagnosis integrated paradigm. DeepSight is low-cost, reproducible, efficient, and highly scalable large-scale model safety evaluation project consisting of a evaluation toolkit DeepSafe and a diagnosis toolkit DeepScan.

It relies on computing pairwise relations between tokens. To reduce the high computational cost of standard quadratic attention, linear attention has been proposed as an efficient approximation. It employs kernel functions that are applied independently to the inputs before the pairwise similarities are calculated. That allows for an efficient computational procedure which, however, amounts to a low-degree rational function approximating softmax.\n  We propose Hadamard Linear Attention (HLA). Unlike previous works on linear attention, the nonlinearity in HLA is not applied separately to queries and keys, but, analogously to standard softmax attention, after the pairwise similarities have been computed. It will be shown that the proposed nonlinearity amounts to a higher-degree rational function to approximate softmax. An efficient computational scheme for the proposed method is derived that is similar to that of standard linear attention. In contrast to other approaches, no time-consuming tensor reshaping is necessary to apply the proposed algorithm. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated by applying it to a large diffusion transformer model for video generation, an application that involves very large amounts of tokens."}

A key challenge is obtaining accurate, user-specific reward signals in open-ended scenarios. Existing personalized reward models face two persistent limitations: (1) oversimplifying diverse, scenario-specific preferences into a small, fixed set of evaluation principles, and (2) struggling with generalization to new users with limited feedback. To this end, we propose P-GenRM, the first Personalized Generative Reward Model with test-time user-based scaling. P-GenRM transforms preference signals into structured evaluation chains that derive adaptive personas and scoring rubrics across various scenarios. It further clusters users into User Prototypes and introduces a dual-granularity scaling mechanism: at the individual level, it adaptively scales and aggregates each user's scoring scheme; at the prototype level, it incorporates preferences from similar users. This design mitigates noise in inferred preferences and enhances generalization to unseen users through prototype-based transfer. Empirical results show that P-GenRM achieves state-of-the-art results on widely-used personalized reward model benchmarks, with an average improvement of 2.31%, and demonstrates strong generalization on an out-of-distribution dataset. Notably, Test-time User-based scaling provides an additional 3% boost, demonstrating stronger personalized alignment with test-time scalability."}

In this setting, we find that prior sparse-attention approximations break down, despite showing strong results for bidirectional, many-step diffusion. Specifically, we observe that video attention is not reliably sparse, but instead combines pronounced periodic structure driven by spatiotemporal position with dynamic, sparse semantic correspondences and dense mixing, exceeding the representational capacity of even oracle top-k attention. Building on this insight, we propose Monarch-RT, a structured attention parameterization for video diffusion models that factorizes attention using Monarch matrices. Through appropriately aligned block structure and our extended tiled Monarch parameterization, we achieve high expressivity while preserving computational efficiency. We further overcome the overhead of parameterization through finetuning, with custom Triton kernels. We first validate the high efficacy of Monarch-RT over existing sparse baselines designed only for bidirectional models. We further observe that Monarch-RT attains up to 95% attention sparsity with no loss in quality when applied to the state-of-the-art model Self-Forcing, making Monarch-RT a pioneering work on highly-capable sparse attention parameterization for real-time video generation.

This approach enables the compression of data into sequences of tokens rather than traditional vector representations. Unlike auto-encoders, which typically encode information into continuous latent spaces, our method preserves the token-based structure, aligning more closely with the original data format. This preservation allows for higher compression ratios while maintaining semantic integrity. By training the model using an off-policy Reinforcement Learning algorithm, we optimize sequence length to minimize redundancy and enhance compression efficiency. Our method introduces an efficient and adaptive data compression system built upon advanced Reinforcement Learning techniques, functioning independently of external grammatical or world knowledge. This approach shows significant improvements in compression ratios compared to conventional methods. By leveraging the latent information within language models, our system effectively compresses data without requiring explicit content understanding, paving the way for more robust and practical compression solutions across various applications."}

Many multimodal tasks, especially those involving complex spatial compositions, multiple interacting objects, or evolving instructions, require decomposing instructions, verifying intermediate results, and making iterative corrections. While test-time scaling (TTS) has demonstrated that allocating additional inference compute for iterative reasoning substantially improves language model performance, extending this paradigm to unified multimodal models remains an open challenge. We introduce UniT, a framework for multimodal chain-of-thought test-time scaling that enables a single unified model to reason, verify, and refine across multiple rounds. UniT combines agentic data synthesis, unified model training, and flexible test-time inference to elicit cognitive behaviors including verification, subgoal decomposition, and content memory. Our key findings are: (1) unified models trained on short reasoning trajectories generalize to longer inference chains at test time; (2) sequential chain-of-thought reasoning provides a more scalable and compute-efficient TTS strategy than parallel sampling; (3) training on generation and editing trajectories improves out-of-distribution visual reasoning. These results establish multimodal test-time scaling as an effective paradigm for advancing both generation and understanding in unified models."}

In this work, we introduce dVoting, a fast voting technique that boosts reasoning capability without training, with only an acceptable extra computational overhead. dVoting is motivated by the observation that, across multiple samples for the same prompt, token predictions remain largely consistent, whereas performance is determined by a small subset of tokens exhibiting cross-sample variability. Leveraging the arbitrary-position generation capability of dLLMs, dVoting performs iterative refinement by sampling, identifying uncertain tokens via consistency analysis, regenerating them through voting, and repeating this process until convergence. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that dVoting consistently improves performance across various benchmarks.

Here, we use a cognitively-grounded definition of ToM to develop and test a new evaluation framework. Specifically, our approach probes whether LLMs have a coherent, domain-general, and consistent model of how mental states cause behavior -- regardless of whether that model matches a human-like ToM. We find that even though LLMs succeed in approximating human judgments in a simple ToM paradigm, they fail at a logically equivalent task and exhibit low consistency between their action predictions and corresponding mental state inferences. As such, these findings suggest that the social proficiency exhibited by LLMs is not the result of an domain-general or consistent ToM."}

We introduce MuRGAt (Multimodal Reasoning with Grounded Attribution), a benchmark for evaluating fact-level multimodal attribution in settings that require reasoning beyond direct observation.

This benchmark is built on a set of 701 questions sourced from primary school examinations in Zambia and India, which cover a range of tasks such as reasoning by analogy, pattern completion, and spatial matching. We outline the methodology and development of the benchmark which intentionally uses unedited, minimal-text images to test if models can meet realistic needs of primary education. Our findings reveal a ``jagged frontier'' of capability where models demonstrate better proficiency in static skills such as counting and scaling, but reach a distinct ``spatial ceiling'' when faced with dynamic operations like folding, reflection, and rotation. These weaknesses pose a risk for classroom use on visual reasoning problems, with the potential for incorrect marking, false scaffolding, and reinforcing student misconceptions.

For inference, we extend the QBBN with NEG factors enforcing P(x) + P(neg x) = 1, enabling contrapositive reasoning (modus tollens) via backward lambda messages, completing Prawitz's simple elimination rules. The engine handles 44/44 test cases spanning 22 reasoning patterns. For semantics, we present a typed logical language with role-labeled predicates, modal quantifiers, and three tiers of expressiveness following Prawitz: first-order quantification, propositions as arguments, and predicate quantification via lambda abstraction. For syntax, we present a typed slot grammar that deterministically compiles sentences to logical form (33/33 correct, zero ambiguity). LLMs handle disambiguation (95% PP attachment accuracy) but cannot produce structured parses directly (12.4% UAS), confirming grammars are necessary. The architecture: LLM preprocesses, grammar parses, LLM reranks, QBBN infers.\n  We argue this reconciles formal semantics with Sutton's \"bitter lesson\" (2019): LLMs eliminate the annotation bottleneck that killed formal NLP, serving as annotator while the QBBN serves as verifier.

Our approach introduces a three-stage pipeline -- Knowledge Identifier, Organizer, and Adapter (IOA) -- that systematically identifies knowledge deficiencies in student models, organizes knowledge delivery through progressive curricula, and adapts representations to match the cognitive capacity of student models. We integrate Bloom's Mastery Learning Principles and Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development to create a dynamic distillation process where student models approach teacher model's performance on prerequisite knowledge before advancing, and new knowledge is introduced with controlled, gradual difficulty increments. Extensive experiments using LLaMA-3.1/3.2 and Qwen2.5 as student models demonstrate that IOA achieves significant improvements over baseline distillation methods, with student models retaining 94.7% of teacher performance on DollyEval while using less than 1/10th of the parameters.

To address these limitations, we propose OMEGA-Avatar, the first feed-forward framework that simultaneously generates a generalizable, 360°-complete, and animatable 3D Gaussian head from a single image. Starting from a feed-forward and animatable framework, we address the 360° full-head avatar generation problem with two novel components. First, to overcome poor hair modeling in full-head avatar generation, we introduce a semantic-aware mesh deformation module that integrates multi-view normals to optimize a FLAME head with hair while preserving its topology structure. Second, to enable effective feed-forward decoding of full-head features, we propose a multi-view feature splatting module that constructs a shared canonical UV representation from features across multiple views through differentiable bilinear splatting, hierarchical UV mapping, and visibility-aware fusion. This approach preserves both global structural coherence and local high-frequency details across all viewpoints, ensuring 360° consistency without per-instance optimization.

In this paper, we define \\emph{token overflow} as a regime in which compressed representations no longer contain sufficient information to answer a given query, and propose a methodology to characterize and detect it.

In this work, we study synthetic two-dimensional blind deconvolution problems under fully controlled conditions, with complete prior knowledge of both the signal and kernel distributions. We compare tailored MAP algorithms with simple LMMSE estimators whose functional form is closely related to that of an optimal Tikhonov estimator. Our results show that, even in these highly controlled settings, MAP methods remain unstable and require extensive parameter tuning, whereas the LMMSE estimator yields a robust and reliable baseline.

However, this global dependency incurs quadratic complexity in sequence length, inducing an inherent \"encode-the-whole-utterance\" latency profile. For streaming use cases, this causes TTFT to grow linearly with utterance length as the encoder must process the entire prefix before any decoder token can be emitted. To better meet the needs of on-device, streaming ASR use cases we introduce Moonshine v2, an ergodic streaming-encoder ASR model that employs sliding-window self-attention to achieve bounded, low-latency inference while preserving strong local context. Our models achieve state of the art word error rates across standard benchmarks, attaining accuracy on-par with models 6x their size while running significantly faster.

The curriculum aims to foster domain-specific technical AI literacy among stakeholders in the fields of translation and specialised communication by exposing them to the conceptual and technical/algorithmic foundations of modern language-oriented AI in an accessible way. The core curriculum focuses on 1) vector embeddings, 2) the technical foundations of neural networks, 3) tokenization and 4) transformer neural networks. It is intended to help users develop computational thinking as well as algorithmic awareness and algorithmic agency, ultimately contributing to their digital resilience in AI-driven work environments. The didactic suitability of the curriculum was tested in an AI-focused MA course at the Institute of Translation and Multilingual Communication at TH Koeln. Results suggest the didactic effectiveness of the curriculum, but participant feedback indicates that it should be embedded into higher-level didactic scaffolding - e.g., in the form of lecturer support - in order to enable optimal learning conditions."}

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising tools for symbolic equation discovery, owing to their broad domain knowledge and strong reasoning capabilities. However, most existing LLM-based systems try to guess equations directly from data, without modeling the multi-step reasoning process that scientists often follow: first inferring physical properties such as symmetries, then using these as priors to restrict the space of candidate equations. We introduce KeplerAgent, an agentic framework that explicitly follows this scientific reasoning process. The agent coordinates physics-based tools to extract intermediate structure and uses these results to configure symbolic regression engines such as PySINDy and PySR, including their function libraries and structural constraints. Across a suite of physical equation benchmarks, KeplerAgent achieves substantially higher symbolic accuracy and greater robustness to noisy data than both LLM and traditional baselines."}

However, applying reinforcement learning to such settings remains difficult: realistic objectives often lack verifiable rewards and instead emphasize open-ended behaviors; moreover, RL for multi-turn, multi-step agentic tool use is still underexplored; and building and maintaining executable tool environments is costly, limiting scale and coverage. We propose CM2, an RL framework that replaces verifiable outcome rewards with checklist rewards. CM2 decomposes each turn's intended behavior into fine-grained binary criteria with explicit evidence grounding and structured metadata, turning open-ended judging into more stable classification-style decisions. To balance stability and informativeness, our method adopts a strategy of sparse reward assignment but dense evaluation criteria. Training is performed in a scalable LLM-simulated tool environment, avoiding heavy engineering for large tool sets. Experiments show that CM2 consistently improves over supervised fine-tuning. Starting from an 8B Base model and training on an 8k-example RL dataset, CM2 improves over the SFT counterpart by 8 points on tau^-Bench, by 10 points on BFCL-V4, and by 12 points on ToolSandbox. The results match or even outperform similarly sized open-source baselines, including the judging model. CM2 thus provides a scalable recipe for optimizing multi-turn, multi-step tool-using agents without relying on verifiable rewards.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of OPCD on two important applications: experiential knowledge distillation, where models extract and consolidate transferable knowledge from their historical solution traces, and system prompt distillation, where models internalize beneficial behaviors encoded in optimized prompts. Across mathematical reasoning, text-based games, and domain-specific tasks, OPCD consistently outperforms baseline methods, achieving higher task accuracy while better preserving out-of-distribution capabilities.

In this work, we present CATTS, a simple technique for dynamically allocating compute for multi-step agents. We first conduct an empirical study of inference-time scaling for web agents. We find that uniformly increasing per-step compute quickly saturates in long-horizon environments. We then investigate stronger aggregation strategies, including an LLM-based Arbiter that can outperform naive voting, but that can overrule high-consensus decisions. We show that uncertainty statistics derived from the agent's own vote distribution (entropy and top-1/top-2 margin) correlate with downstream success and provide a practical signal for dynamic compute allocation. Based on these findings, we introduce Confidence-Aware Test-Time Scaling (CATTS), which uses vote-derived uncertainty to allocate compute only when decisions are genuinely contentious. CATTS improves performance on WebArena-Lite and GoBrowse by up to 9.1% over React while using up to 2.3x fewer tokens than uniform scaling, providing both efficiency gains and an interpretable decision rule."}

From six public datasets, we clean, standardize, and balance samples to construct UniACT-dataset, a large-scale dataset with over 6 million trajectories and 9,500 hours of data, covering diverse robot morphologies and task scenarios. Unified pre-training improves knowledge transfer and generalization across platforms and tasks, supporting general-purpose embodied intelligence. To improve action prediction efficiency and stability, we propose the Action Manifold Hypothesis: effective robot actions lie not in the full high-dimensional space but on a low-dimensional, smooth manifold governed by physical laws and task constraints. Based on this, we introduce Action Manifold Learning (AML), which uses a DiT backbone to predict clean, continuous action sequences directly. This shifts learning from denoising to projection onto feasible manifolds, improving decoding speed and policy stability. ABot-M0 supports modular perception via a dual-stream mechanism that integrates VLM semantics with geometric priors and multi-view inputs from plug-and-play 3D modules such as VGGT and Qwen-Image-Edit, enhancing spatial understanding without modifying the backbone and mitigating standard VLM limitations in 3D reasoning.

This systematic literature review analyzes research published between 2020 and 2025 across seven premier venues: ACL, AIES, CHI, CSCW, EAAMO, FAccT, and NeurIPS, investigating the mechanisms in data annotation practices that facilitate this \"consensus trap\". Our identification phase captured 30,897 records, which were refined via a tiered keyword filtration schema to a high-recall corpus of 3,042 records for manual screening, resulting in a final included corpus of 346 papers for qualitative synthesis. Our reflexive thematic analysis reveals that systemic failures in positional legibility, combined with the recent architectural shift toward human-as-verifier models, specifically the reliance on model-mediated annotations, introduce deep-seated anchoring bias and effectively remove human voices from the loop. We further demonstrate how geographic hegemony imposes Western norms as universal benchmarks, often enforced by the performative alignment of precarious data workers who prioritize requester compliance over honest subjectivity to avoid economic penalties. Critiquing the \"noisy sensor\" fallacy, where statistical models misdiagnose cultural pluralism as random error, we argue for reclaiming disagreement as a high-fidelity signal essential for building culturally competent models. To address these systemic tensions, we propose a roadmap for pluralistic annotation infrastructures that shift the objective from discovering a singular \"right\" answer to mapping the diversity of human experience."}

However, existing RAG studies typically assume well-structured textual sources (e.g. Wikipedia or curated datasets) and perform retrieval and generation at query time, which can limit their applicability in real-world chatbot scenarios. In this paper, we present HybridRAG, a novel and practical RAG framework towards more accurate and faster chatbot responses. First, HybridRAG ingests raw, unstructured PDF documents containing complex layouts (text, tables, figures) via Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and layout analysis, and convert them into hierarchical text chunks. Then, it pre-generates a plausible question-answer (QA) knowledge base from the organized chunks using an LLM. At query time, user questions are matched against this QA bank to retrieve immediate answers when possible, and only if no suitable QA match is found does our framework fall back to an on-the-fly response generation. Experiments on OHRBench demonstrate that our HybridRAG provides higher answer quality and lower latency compared to a standard RAG baseline. We believe that HybridRAG could be a practical solution for real-world chatbot applications that must handle large volumes of unstructured documents and lots of users under limited computational resources."}

Existing benchmarks focus primarily on the computational aspect of this task, testing agents' ability to reproduce or replicate research outcomes when having access to the code and data. This setting, while foundational, (1) fails to capture the inconsistent availability of new data for replication as opposed to reproduction, and (2) lacks ground-truth diversity by focusing only on reproducible papers, thereby failing to evaluate an agent's ability to identify non-replicable research. Furthermore, most benchmarks only evaluate outcomes rather than the replication process. In response, we introduce ReplicatorBench, an end-to-end benchmark, including human-verified replicable and non-replicable research claims in social and behavioral sciences for evaluating AI agents in research replication across three stages: (1) extraction and retrieval of replication data; (2) design and execution of computational experiments; and (3) interpretation of results, allowing a test of AI agents' capability to mimic the activities of human replicators in real world. To set a baseline of AI agents' capability, we develop ReplicatorAgent, an agentic framework equipped with necessary tools, like web search and iterative interaction with sandboxed environments, to accomplish tasks in ReplicatorBench. We evaluate ReplicatorAgent across four underlying large language models (LLMs), as well as different design choices of programming language and levels of code access. Our findings reveal that while current LLM agents are capable of effectively designing and executing computational experiments, they struggle with retrieving resources, such as new data, necessary to replicate a claim.

To bridge this gap, this work introduces PhyNiKCE (Physical and Numerical Knowledgeable Context Engineering), a neurosymbolic agentic framework for trustworthy engineering. Unlike standard black-box agents, PhyNiKCE decouples neural planning from symbolic validation. It employs a Symbolic Knowledge Engine that treats simulation setup as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem, rigidly enforcing physical constraints via a Deterministic RAG Engine with specialized retrieval strategies for solvers, turbulence models, and boundary conditions. Validated through rigorous OpenFOAM experiments on practical, non-tutorial CFD tasks using Gemini-2.5-Pro/Flash, PhyNiKCE demonstrates a 96% relative improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, by replacing trial-and-error with knowledge-driven initialization, the framework reduced autonomous self-correction loops by 59% while simultaneously lowering LLM token consumption by 17%. These results demonstrate that decoupling neural generation from symbolic constraint enforcement significantly enhances robustness and efficiency.

We investigate how four open-source LLMs (Llama3.1-8B, Mistral-7B, Gemma-2-9B, and GPT-OSS-20B) respond to these questions, evaluating alignment using lexical metrics (BLEU, ROUGE), semantic similarity (BERTScore, MoverScore, cosine similarity), and logical inference (NLI). Our central finding is a striking semantic-lexical paradox: all models achieve over 99% cosine similarity with references despite less than 8% BLEU-1 overlap, a 90+ percentage point gap indicating that models preserve meaning through extensive paraphrasing rather than lexical reproduction. MoverScore (51-53%) confirms this pattern, occupying an intermediate position that reflects the optimal transport cost of semantic alignment. Furthermore, model scale does not predict performance: Mistral-7B (7B parameters) outperforms GPT-OSS-20B (20B parameters) across all metrics. NLI analysis reveals that contradiction rates remain below 7%, suggesting models rarely generate content that directly conflicts with human consensus.

Analysis of model confidence dynamics under latent reasoning reveals that thinking trajectories ending in incorrect answers contain fewer low-confidence steps than those ending in correct answers. Meanwhile, we suggest that soft embeddings aggregated by multiple low-confidence thinking alternatives may introduce and propagate noise, leading to high confidence in unreliable reasoning trajectories. Motivated by these observations, ThinkRouter, an inference-time confidence-aware routing mechanism is proposed to avoid high confidence and noise for efficient reasoning. ThinkRouter routes thinking to the discrete token space when model confidence is low, and to the latent space otherwise. Extensive experiments on STEM reasoning and coding benchmarks across diverse large reasoning models demonstrate that ThinkRouter outperforms explicit CoT, random routing, and latent reasoning baselines in terms of accuracy, achieving an average improvement of 19.70 points in Pass@1, while reducing generation length by up to 15.55%. Further comprehensive analysis reveals that ThinkRouter can calibrate errors arising from explicit CoT and latent reasoning, and accelerates end-of-thinking token generation by globally lowering model confidence."}

For each model, we evaluate performance using seven unsupervised hallucination detection methods spanning three complementary approaches: semantic consistency based detectors, confidence based detectors, and entropy based detectors. This multifaceted evaluation enables us to characterize how PEFT reshapes uncertainty across different detection paradigms. In conclusion, our experimental results show that PEFT consistently strengthens hallucination detection ability, substantially improving AUROC across a wide range of hallucination detectors.

TSR performs lightweight tree-style search to construct high-quality trajectories by selecting high-scoring actions at each turn using task-specific feedback. This improves rollout quality and stabilizes learning while leaving the underlying optimization objective unchanged, making TSR optimizer-agnostic. We instantiate TSR with best-of-N, beam, and shallow lookahead search, and pair it with PPO and GRPO, achieving up to 15% performance gains and more stable learning on Sokoban, FrozenLake, and WebShop tasks at a one-time increase in training compute. By moving search from inference time to the rollout stage of training, TSR provides a simple and general mechanism for stronger multi-turn agent learning, complementary to existing frameworks and rejection-sampling-style selection methods."}

However, it remains a challenging problem in cases where the categories are unavailable, difficult to differentiate, or are interrelated. Social analysis with human context is an area that can benefit from text classification, as it relies substantially on text data. The focus of this paper is to enhance the classification of text according to the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by collecting and combining intelligence from multiple models. Combinatorial Fusion Analysis (CFA), a system fusion paradigm using a rank-score characteristic (RSC) function and cognitive diversity (CD), has been used to enhance classifier methods by combining a set of relatively good and mutually diverse classification models. We use a generative AI model to generate synthetic data for model training and then apply CFA to this classification task. The CFA technique achieves 96.73% performance, outperforming the best individual model. We compare the outcomes with those obtained from human domain experts. It is demonstrated that combining intelligence from multiple ML/AI models using CFA and getting input from human experts can, not only complement, but also enhance each other."}

To address this problem, we propose LAVES, a hierarchical LLM-based multi-agent system for generating high-quality instructional videos from educational problems. The LAVES formulates educational video generation as a multi-objective task that simultaneously demands correct step-by-step reasoning, pedagogically coherent narration, semantically faithful visual demonstrations, and precise audio--visual alignment. To address the limitations of prior approaches--including low procedural fidelity, high production cost, and limited controllability--LAVES decomposes the generation workflow into specialized agents coordinated by a central Orchestrating Agent with explicit quality gates and iterative critique mechanisms. Specifically, the Orchestrating Agent supervises a Solution Agent for rigorous problem solving, an Illustration Agent that produces executable visualization codes, and a Narration Agent for learner-oriented instructional scripts. In addition, all outputs from the working agents are subject to semantic critique, rule-based constraints, and tool-based compilation checks. Rather than directly synthesizing pixels, the system constructs a structured executable video script that is deterministically compiled into synchronized visuals and narration using template-driven assembly rules, enabling fully automated end-to-end production without manual editing. In large-scale deployments, LAVES achieves a throughput exceeding one million videos per day, delivering over a 95% reduction in cost compared to current industry-standard approaches while maintaining a high acceptance rate."}

Unlike pretraining methods, which optimize models using token-level probabilities, RLVR fine-tunes models based on reward feedback from self-generated reasoning trajectories, making conventional likelihood-based detection methods less effective. We show that RLVR induces a distinctive behavioral signature: prompts encountered during RLVR training result in more rigid and similar generations, while unseen prompts retain greater diversity. We introduce Min-$k$NN Distance, a simple black-box detector that quantifies this collapse by sampling multiple completions for a given prompt and computing the average of the $k$ smallest nearest-neighbor edit distances. Min-$k$NN Distance requires no access to the reference model or token probabilities. Experiments across multiple RLVR-trained reasoning models show that Min-$k$NN Distance reliably distinguishes RL-seen examples from unseen ones and outperforms existing membership inference and RL contamination detection baselines."}

Although LoRA makes fine-tuning efficient, it is highly sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters, and exhaustive hyperparameter search is still computationally very demanding. To address these challenges, we propose a framework that integrates the domain knowledge of pre-trained LLMs into Bayesian Optimization (BO) to efficiently search for LoRA hyperparameters. To leverage the informed knowledge of LLMs, we repurpose LLMs as a discrete-to-continuous mapping to link the hyperparameters and their domain knowledge with a continuous vector space, where BO is conducted. We design and control the mapping by language prompting, where we provide a domain-aware textual prompt describing the relationships among hyperparameters and their respective roles; thereby, we explicitly inject domain knowledge about LoRA into the LLM in natural language. Also, we model the residual information that is hard to linguistically describe in the prompt with an additional learnable token. This aids BO to sample more high-performing hyperparameters. In addition, by leveraging the observation of the strong correlation between the respective performance obtained from full and subset training datasets in LoRA training regimes, we introduce proxy training and evaluation with a data subset. This further increases the efficiency of our method. We demonstrate that our hyperparameter found with only about 30 iterations achieves more than 20% performance improvement over standard hyperparameters found from about 45,000 combinations."}

Furthermore, while autoregressive LMs can output explicit reasoning, their true reasoning process is opaque, which introduces risks like deception and hallucination. In this work, we introduce the Prototype Transformer (ProtoT) -- an autoregressive LM architecture based on prototypes (parameter vectors), posed as an alternative to the standard self-attention-based transformers. ProtoT works by means of two-way communication between the input sequence and the prototypes, and we show that this leads to the prototypes automatically capturing nameable concepts (e.g. \"woman\") during training. They provide the potential to interpret the model's reasoning and allow for targeted edits of its behavior. Furthermore, by design, the prototypes create communication channels that aggregate contextual information at different time scales, aiding interpretability. In terms of computation scalability, ProtoT scales linearly with sequence length vs the quadratic scalability of SOTA self-attention transformers. Compared to baselines, ProtoT scales well with model and data size, and performs well on text generation and downstream tasks (GLUE). ProtoT exhibits robustness to input perturbations on par or better than some baselines, but differs from them by providing interpretable pathways showing how robustness and sensitivity arises. Reaching close to the performance of state-of-the-art architectures, ProtoT paves the way to creating well-performing autoregressive LMs interpretable by design."}

Recent \"Thinking-with-Images\" methods alleviate this by iteratively zooming in and out regions of interest during inference, but incur high latency due to repeated tool calls and visual re-encoding. To address this, we propose Region-to-Image Distillation, which transforms zooming from an inference-time tool into a training-time primitive, thereby internalizing the benefits of agentic zooming into a single forward pass of an MLLM. In particular, we first zoom in to micro-cropped regions to let strong teacher models generate high-quality VQA data, and then distill this region-grounded supervision back to the full image. After training on such data, the smaller student model improves \"single-glance\" fine-grained perception without tool use. To rigorously evaluate this capability, we further present ZoomBench, a hybrid-annotated benchmark of 845 VQA data spanning six fine-grained perceptual dimensions, together with a dual-view protocol that quantifies the global--regional \"zooming gap\". Experiments show that our models achieve leading performance across multiple fine-grained perception benchmarks, and also improve general multimodal cognition on benchmarks such as visual reasoning and GUI agents.

Existing data-driven agent-based models--from rule-based to deep learning--struggle in low-data environments, limiting their practicality. This paper investigates whether large language models, pre-trained on broad human knowledge, can fill this gap by reasoning about everyday activities from compact contextual cues. We adopt a retrieval-augmented prompting strategy that integrates four sources of context--temporal, spatial, behavioral history, and persona--and evaluate it on the CASAS Aruba smart-home dataset. The evaluation spans two complementary tasks: next-activity prediction with duration estimation, and multi-step daily sequence generation, each tested with various numbers of few-shot examples provided in the prompt. Analyzing few-shot effects reveals how much contextual supervision is sufficient to balance data efficiency and predictive accuracy, particularly in low-data environments. Results show that large language models exhibit strong inherent temporal understanding of human behavior: even in zero-shot settings, they produce coherent daily activity predictions, while adding one or two demonstrations further refines duration calibration and categorical accuracy. Beyond a few examples, performance saturates, indicating diminishing returns. Sequence-level evaluation confirms consistent temporal alignment across few-shot conditions. These findings suggest that pre-trained language models can serve as promising temporal reasoners, capturing both recurring routines and context-dependent behavioral variations, thereby strengthening the behavioral modules of agent-based models."}

Selective Abstraction for Reliable Long-Form Text Generation", "comment": null, "summary": "LLMs are widely used, yet they remain prone to factual errors that erode user trust and limit adoption in high-risk settings. One approach to mitigate this risk is to equip models with uncertainty estimation mechanisms that abstain when confidence is low. However, this binary \"all-or-nothing\" approach is excessively restrictive in long-form settings, often discarding valuable information. We introduce Selective Abstraction (SA), a framework that enables LLMs to trade specificity for reliability by selectively reducing the detail of uncertain content. We first formalize SA through the lenses of selective risk and coverage. We then propose Atom-wise Selective Abstraction, a claim-level instantiation that decomposes responses into atomic claims (short, self-contained statements each expressing a single fact) and replaces uncertain atoms with higher confidence, less specific abstractions. To evaluate this framework, we develop a novel end-to-end pipeline for open-ended generation that instantiates risk as factual correctness and measures coverage using an information-theoretic measure of retained information. Across six open-source models on the FactScore and LongFact-Objects benchmarks, atom-wise SA consistently outperforms existing baselines, improving the area under the risk-coverage curve (AURC) by up to 27.73% over claim removal, demonstrating that reducing specificity can boost accuracy and reliability while preserving most of their original meaning."}

We employ probing techniques to analyze intermediate activations across transformer layers, and we observe that, after fine-tuning, the probing values of specific words and special markers change substantially, indicating that these elements assume a crucial role in the model's improved detection performance. Guided by this insight, we design a curated set of task-aware special markers and train a sequence-to-sequence model as a data-synthesis tool that leverages these markers to generate structurally consistent and diagnostically informative synthetic samples.

We investigate this by replacing the Transformer blocks in TRM with Mamba-2 hybrid operators while maintaining parameter parity (6.83M vs 6.86M parameters). On ARC-AGI-1, we find that the hybrid improves pass@2 (the official metric) by +2.0\\% (45.88\\% vs 43.88\\%) and consistently outperforms at higher K values (+4.75\\% at pass@100), whilst maintaining pass@1 parity.

However, they often generate over-long chains-of-thought that, driven by substantial reflections such as repetitive self-questioning and circular reasoning, lead to high token consumption, substantial computational overhead, and increased latency without improving accuracy, particularly in smaller models. Our observation reveals that increasing problem complexity induces more excessive and unnecessary reflection, which in turn reduces accuracy and increases token overhead. To address this challenge, we propose Adaptive Reflection and Length Coordinated Penalty (ARLCP), a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to dynamically balance reasoning efficiency and solution accuracy. ARLCP introduces two key innovations: (1) a reflection penalty that adaptively curtails unnecessary reflective steps while preserving essential reasoning, and (2) a length penalty calibrated to the estimated complexity of the problem. By coordinating these penalties, ARLCP encourages the model to generate more concise and effective reasoning paths. We evaluate our method on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks using DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B models. Experimental results show that ARLCP achieves a superior efficiency-accuracy trade-off compared to existing approaches. For the 1.5B model, it reduces the average response length by 53.1% while simultaneously improving accuracy by 5.8%. For the 7B model, it achieves a 35.0% reduction in length with a 2.7% accuracy gain. The code is released at https://github.com/ZeweiYu1/ARLCP ."}

We show that self-referential vocabulary tracks concurrent activation dynamics, and that this correspondence is specific to self-referential processing. We introduce the Pull Methodology, a protocol that elicits extended self-examination through format engineering, and use it to identify a direction in activation space that distinguishes self-referential from descriptive processing in Llama 3.1. The direction is orthogonal to the known refusal direction, localised at 6.25% of model depth, and causally influences introspective output when used for steering. When models produce \"loop\" vocabulary, their activations exhibit higher autocorrelation (r = 0.44, p = 0.002); when they produce \"shimmer\" vocabulary under steering, activation variability increases (r = 0.36, p = 0.002). Critically, the same vocabulary in non-self-referential contexts shows no activation correspondence despite nine-fold higher frequency. Qwen 2.5-32B, with no shared training, independently develops different introspective vocabulary tracking different activation metrics, all absent in descriptive controls.

Traditional compression techniques, such as dictionary-based and statistical methods, often struggle to optimally exploit the structure and redundancy in complex data formats. Recent advancements in deep learning have opened new avenues for compression; however, many existing approaches depend on dense vector representations that obscure the underlying token structure. To address these limitations, we propose a novel lossless compression method that leverages Reinforcement Learning applied to a T5 language model architecture. This approach enables the compression of data into sequences of tokens rather than traditional vector representations. Unlike auto-encoders, which typically encode information into continuous latent spaces, our method preserves the token-based structure, aligning more closely with the original data format. This preservation allows for higher compression ratios while maintaining semantic integrity. By training the model using an off-policy Reinforcement Learning algorithm, we optimize sequence length to minimize redundancy and enhance compression efficiency. Our method introduces an efficient and adaptive data compression system built upon advanced Reinforcement Learning techniques, functioning independently of external grammatical or world knowledge. This approach shows significant improvements in compression ratios compared to conventional methods. By leveraging the latent information within language models, our system effectively compresses data without requiring explicit content understanding, paving the way for more robust and practical compression solutions across various applications."}

However, their problem-solving ability often declines on more complex tasks due to hallucinations and the accumulation of errors within these intermediate steps. Recent work has introduced the notion of critical tokens--tokens in the reasoning process that exert significant influence on subsequent steps. Prior studies suggest that replacing critical tokens can refine reasoning trajectories. Nonetheless, reliably identifying and exploiting critical tokens remains challenging. To address this, we propose the Paraphrastic Probing and Consistency Verification~(PPCV) framework. PPCV operates in two stages. In the first stage, we roll out an initial reasoning path from the original question and then concatenate paraphrased versions of the question with this reasoning path. And we identify critical tokens based on mismatches between the predicted top-1 token and the expected token in the reasoning path. A criterion is employed to confirm the final critical token. In the second stage, we substitute critical tokens with candidate alternatives and roll out new reasoning paths for both the original and paraphrased questions. The final answer is determined by checking the consistency of outputs across these parallel reasoning processes. We evaluate PPCV on mainstream LLMs across multiple benchmarks. Extensive experiments demonstrate PPCV substantially enhances the reasoning performance of LLMs compared to baselines."}

Here, we use a cognitively-grounded definition of ToM to develop and test a new evaluation framework. Specifically, our approach probes whether LLMs have a coherent, domain-general, and consistent model of how mental states cause behavior -- regardless of whether that model matches a human-like ToM. We find that even though LLMs succeed in approximating human judgments in a simple ToM paradigm, they fail at a logically equivalent task and exhibit low consistency between their action predictions and corresponding mental state inferences. As such, these findings suggest that the social proficiency exhibited by LLMs is not the result of an domain-general or consistent ToM."}

In this paper, we propose a novel pedagogically-inspired framework for LLM knowledge distillation that draws from fundamental educational principles. Our approach introduces a three-stage pipeline -- Knowledge Identifier, Organizer, and Adapter (IOA) -- that systematically identifies knowledge deficiencies in student models, organizes knowledge delivery through progressive curricula, and adapts representations to match the cognitive capacity of student models. We integrate Bloom's Mastery Learning Principles and Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development to create a dynamic distillation process where student models approach teacher model's performance on prerequisite knowledge before advancing, and new knowledge is introduced with controlled, gradual difficulty increments. Extensive experiments using LLaMA-3.1/3.2 and Qwen2.5 as student models demonstrate that IOA achieves significant improvements over baseline distillation methods, with student models retaining 94.7% of teacher performance on DollyEval while using less than 1/10th of the parameters. Our framework particularly excels in complex reasoning tasks, showing 19.2% improvement on MATH and 22.3% on HumanEval compared with state-of-the-art baselines."}

Existing methods fail to resolve the resulting plasticity--stability dilemma, often suppressing necessary learning signals alongside harmful ones. To address this issue, we unify token-level SFT objectives within a generalized deformed-log family and expose a universal gate $\\times$ error gradient structure, where the gate controls how much the model trusts its current prediction. By employing the Cayley transform, we map the model's continuously evolving uncertainty onto a continuous focus trajectory, which enables seamless interpolation between scenarios involving uncertain novel concepts and those involving well-established knowledge. We then introduce Dynamic Entropy Fine-Tuning (DEFT), a parameter-free objective that modulates the trust gate using distribution concentration (Rényi-2 entropy) as a practical proxy for the model's predictive state. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate that DEFT achieves a better balance between exploration and exploitation, leading to improved overall performance."}

We evaluate 15 models from OpenAI, Deepgram, Google, and Microsoft on recordings from linguistically diverse U.S. speakers and find an average transcription error rate of 44%. We quantify the downstream impact of failed transcriptions by geographic locations and show that mis-transcriptions systematically cause errors for all speakers, but that routing distance errors are twice as large for non-English primary speakers compared to English primary speakers.

In this work, we present CATTS, a simple technique for dynamically allocating compute for multi-step agents. We first conduct an empirical study of inference-time scaling for web agents. We find that uniformly increasing per-step compute quickly saturates in long-horizon environments. We then investigate stronger aggregation strategies, including an LLM-based Arbiter that can outperform naive voting, but that can overrule high-consensus decisions. We show that uncertainty statistics derived from the agent's own vote distribution (entropy and top-1/top-2 margin) correlate with downstream success and provide a practical signal for dynamic compute allocation. Based on these findings, we introduce Confidence-Aware Test-Time Scaling (CATTS), which uses vote-derived uncertainty to allocate compute only when decisions are genuinely contentious. CATTS improves performance on WebArena-Lite and GoBrowse by up to 9.1% over React while using up to 2.3x fewer tokens than uniform scaling, providing both efficiency gains and an interpretable decision rule."}

In addition, ULF DTI scans exhibit artifacting that spans both the space and angular domains, requiring a custom modelling algorithm for subsequent correction. We introduce a nine-direction, single-shell ULF DTI sequence, as well as a companion Bayesian bias field correction algorithm that possesses angular dependence and convolutional neural network-based superresolution algorithm that is generalizable across DTI datasets and does not require re-training (''DiffSR''). We show through a synthetic downsampling experiment and white matter assessment in real, matched ULF and high-field DTI scans that these algorithms can recover microstructural and volumetric white matter information at ULF. We also show that DiffSR can be directly applied to white matter-based Alzheimers disease classification in synthetically degraded scans, with notable improvements in agreement between DTI metrics, as compared to un-degraded scans.

We introduce MuRGAt (Multimodal Reasoning with Grounded Attribution), a benchmark for evaluating fact-level multimodal attribution in settings that require reasoning beyond direct observation. Given inputs spanning video, audio, and other modalities, MuRGAt requires models to generate answers with explicit reasoning and precise citations, where each citation specifies both modality and temporal segments. To enable reliable assessment, we introduce an automatic evaluation framework that strongly correlates with human judgments. Benchmarking with human and automated scores reveals that even strong MLLMs frequently hallucinate citations despite correct reasoning.

However, this approach requires substantial computational resources due to its reliance on an LLM and numerous visual tokens from sensor inputs, which are limited in autonomous vehicles. Many MLLM studies have explored reducing visual tokens, but often suffer end-task performance degradation compared to using all tokens.\n  To enable efficient E2E driving while maintaining performance comparable to using all tokens, this paper proposes the first Supervised Token Reduction framework for multi-modal LLMs (SToRM). The proposed framework consists of three key elements. First, a lightweight importance predictor with short-term sliding windows estimates token importance scores. Second, a supervised training approach uses an auxiliary path to obtain pseudo-supervision signals from an all-token LLM pass. Third, an anchor-context merging module partitions tokens into anchors and context tokens, and merges context tokens into relevant anchors to reduce redundancy while minimizing information loss. Experiments on the LangAuto benchmark show that SToRM outperforms state-of-the-art E2E driving MLLMs under the same reduced-token budget, maintaining all-token performance while reducing computational cost by up to 30x."}

To demonstrate PatientHub's utility, we implement several representative patient simulation methods as case studies, showcasing how our framework supports standardized cross-method evaluation and the seamless integration of custom evaluation metrics. We further demonstrate PatientHub's extensibility by prototyping two new simulator variants, highlighting how PatientHub accelerates method development by eliminating infrastructure overhead. By consolidating existing work into a single reproducible pipeline, PatientHub lowers the barrier to developing new simulation methods and facilitates cross-method and cross-model benchmarking. Our framework provides a practical foundation for future datasets, methods, and benchmarks in patient-centered dialogue, and the code is publicly available via https://github.com/Sahandfer/PatientHub."}

We identified three desirable attributes of avatar generation: 1) the method should be feed-forward, 2) model a 360° full-head, and 3) should be animation-ready. However, current work addresses only two of the three points simultaneously. To address these limitations, we propose OMEGA-Avatar, the first feed-forward framework that simultaneously generates a generalizable, 360°-complete, and animatable 3D Gaussian head from a single image. Starting from a feed-forward and animatable framework, we address the 360° full-head avatar generation problem with two novel components. First, to overcome poor hair modeling in full-head avatar generation, we introduce a semantic-aware mesh deformation module that integrates multi-view normals to optimize a FLAME head with hair while preserving its topology structure. Second, to enable effective feed-forward decoding of full-head features, we propose a multi-view feature splatting module that constructs a shared canonical UV representation from features across multiple views through differentiable bilinear splatting, hierarchical UV mapping, and visibility-aware fusion. This approach preserves both global structural coherence and local high-frequency details across all viewpoints, ensuring 360° consistency without per-instance optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OMEGA-Avatar achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing baselines in 360° full-head completeness while robustly preserving identity across different viewpoints."}

We curated a large single-centre DSA dataset of 99,349 frames and trained a conditional LDM using text embeddings that encoded anatomy and acquisition geometry. To assess clinical realism, four medical experts, including two neuroradiologists, one neurosurgeon, and one internal medicine expert, systematically rated 400 synthetic DSA images using a 5-grade Likert scale for evaluating proximal large, medium, and small peripheral vessels. The generated images achieved image-wise overall Likert scores ranging from 3.1 to 3.3, with high inter-rater reliability (ICC(2,k) = 0.80--0.87).

Recent approaches using Large Language Models (LLMs) for 3D scene generation show promise but often lack domain-specific reasoning, verification mechanisms, and modular design. These limitations lead to reduced control and poor scalability. This paper investigates the use of LLMs to generate agricultural synthetic simulation environments from natural language prompts, specifically to address the limitations of lacking domain-specific reasoning, verification mechanisms, and modular design. A modular multi-LLM pipeline was developed, integrating 3D asset retrieval, domain knowledge injection, and code generation for the Unreal rendering engine using its API. This results in a 3D environment with realistic planting layouts and environmental context, all based on the input prompt and the domain knowledge. To enhance accuracy and scalability, the system employs a hybrid strategy combining LLM optimization techniques such as few-shot prompting, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), finetuning, and validation. Unlike monolithic models, the modular architecture enables structured data handling, intermediate verification, and flexible expansion. The system was evaluated using structured prompts and semantic accuracy metrics. A user study assessed realism and familiarity against real-world images, while an expert comparison demonstrated significant time savings over manual scene design. The results confirm the effectiveness of multi-LLM pipelines in automating domain-specific 3D scene generation with improved reliability and precision. Future work will explore expanding the asset hierarchy, incorporating real-time generation, and adapting the pipeline to other simulation domains beyond agriculture."}

This paper introduces MiniCPM-SALA, a 9B-parameter hybrid architecture that integrates the high-fidelity long-context modeling of sparse attention (InfLLM-V2) with the global efficiency of linear attention (Lightning Attention). By employing a layer selection algorithm to integrate these mechanisms in a 1:3 ratio and utilizing a hybrid positional encoding (HyPE), the model maintains efficiency and performance for long-context tasks. Furthermore, we introduce a cost-effective continual training framework that transforms pre-trained Transformer-based models into hybrid models, which reduces training costs by approximately 75% compared to training from scratch. Extensive experiments show that MiniCPM-SALA maintains general capabilities comparable to full-attention models while offering improved efficiency. On a single NVIDIA A6000D GPU, the model achieves up to 3.5x the inference speed of the full-attention model at the sequence length of 256K tokens and supports context lengths of up to 1M tokens, a scale where traditional full-attention 8B models fail because of memory constraints."}

Recent \"Thinking-with-Images\" methods alleviate this by iteratively zooming in and out regions of interest during inference, but incur high latency due to repeated tool calls and visual re-encoding. To address this, we propose Region-to-Image Distillation, which transforms zooming from an inference-time tool into a training-time primitive, thereby internalizing the benefits of agentic zooming into a single forward pass of an MLLM. In particular, we first zoom in to micro-cropped regions to let strong teacher models generate high-quality VQA data, and then distill this region-grounded supervision back to the full image. After training on such data, the smaller student model improves \"single-glance\" fine-grained perception without tool use. To rigorously evaluate this capability, we further present ZoomBench, a hybrid-annotated benchmark of 845 VQA data spanning six fine-grained perceptual dimensions, together with a dual-view protocol that quantifies the global--regional \"zooming gap\". Experiments show that our models achieve leading performance across multiple fine-grained perception benchmarks, and also improve general multimodal cognition on benchmarks such as visual reasoning and GUI agents. We further discuss when \"Thinking-with-Images\" is necessary versus when its gains can be distilled into a single forward pass.

In recent years, several ring artifact reduction solutions have been proposed in the image domain or in the sinogram domain using supervised deep learning methods. However, these methods require dedicated datasets for training, leading to a high data collection cost. Furthermore, existing approaches focus exclusively on either image-space or sinogram-space correction, neglecting the intrinsic correlations from the forward operation of the CT geometry. Based on the theoretical analysis of non-ideal CT detector responses, the RAR problem is reformulated as an inverse problem by using an unrolled network, which considers non-ideal response together with linear forward-projection with CT geometry. Additionally, the intrinsic correlations of ring artifacts between the sinogram and image domains are leveraged through synthetic data derived from natural images, enabling the trained model to correct artifacts without requiring real-world clinical data. Extensive evaluations on diverse scanning geometries and anatomical regions demonstrate that the model trained on synthetic data consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods."}

Our approach first trains INRs to capture continuous spatial representations of LGE data and associated myocardium and fibrosis masks. These INRs are then compressed into compact latent embeddings, preserving essential anatomical information. A diffusion model operates on this latent space to generate new representations, which are decoded into synthetic LGE images with anatomically consistent segmentation masks. Experiments on 133 cardiac MRI scans suggest that augmenting training data with 200 synthetic volumes contributes to improved fibrosis segmentation performance, with the Dice score showing an increase from 0.509 to 0.524.

This benchmark is built on a set of 701 questions sourced from primary school examinations in Zambia and India, which cover a range of tasks such as reasoning by analogy, pattern completion, and spatial matching. We outline the methodology and development of the benchmark which intentionally uses unedited, minimal-text images to test if models can meet realistic needs of primary education. Our findings reveal a ``jagged frontier'' of capability where models demonstrate better proficiency in static skills such as counting and scaling, but reach a distinct ``spatial ceiling'' when faced with dynamic operations like folding, reflection, and rotation.

Many multimodal tasks, especially those involving complex spatial compositions, multiple interacting objects, or evolving instructions, require decomposing instructions, verifying intermediate results, and making iterative corrections. While test-time scaling (TTS) has demonstrated that allocating additional inference compute for iterative reasoning substantially improves language model performance, extending this paradigm to unified multimodal models remains an open challenge. We introduce UniT, a framework for multimodal chain-of-thought test-time scaling that enables a single unified model to reason, verify, and refine across multiple rounds. UniT combines agentic data synthesis, unified model training, and flexible test-time inference to elicit cognitive behaviors including verification, subgoal decomposition, and content memory. Our key findings are: (1) unified models trained on short reasoning trajectories generalize to longer inference chains at test time; (2) sequential chain-of-thought reasoning provides a more scalable and compute-efficient TTS strategy than parallel sampling; (3) training on generation and editing trajectories improves out-of-distribution visual reasoning. These results establish multimodal test-time scaling as an effective paradigm for advancing both generation and understanding in unified models."}
