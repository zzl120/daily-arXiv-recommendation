However, in the absence of explicit intrinsic principles for semantic composition, existing methods treat synergistic drugs as independent entities and fail to capture their collective therapeutic effects, resulting in a mismatch between medication-level references and longitudinal patient representations. In this paper, we propose MSAM, a novel medication recommendation model that bridges the gap via multi-level medication abstraction. The model introduces a multi-head graph reasoning mechanism to organize flat daily medication sets into clinically meaningful semantic units, serving as intermediate abstraction results to propagate features from individual drugs to higher-level representations. Building on these units, MSAM performs two-stage abstraction over historical prescriptions and selected candidates via intra- and inter-level feature propagation across heterogeneous clinical structures, capturing collective therapeutic effects aligned with patient conditions. Experiments on two real-world clinical datasets show that MSAM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, validating the effectiveness of structural medication abstraction for recommendation."}

To address these shortcomings, this paper proposes a Geometric Sparrow Search Algorithm (GeoSSA). By integrating Good Nodes Set initialization, a Sine-Cosine Enhanced Producer position update strategy, and a Triangular-Walk Enhanced Edge Sparrow update strategy, GeoSSA significantly improves the global exploration ability, local exploitation efficiency, and convergence stability of the original SSA. To thoroughly validate the effectiveness of GeoSSA, we conducted ablation studies, qualitative analysis, and comparative experiments on 23 benchmark functions against state-of-the-art algorithms. Experimental results show that GeoSSA achieves the best or near-best performance in terms of average fitness, standard deviation, Wilcoxon tests, and Friedman rankings, with an Overall Effectiveness ($OE$) of 95.65\\%. Its overall performance is significantly superior to all compared algorithms. In three-dimensional UAV path planning tasks, GeoSSA demonstrates excellent stability and superior path quality. In four categories of engineering design optimization problems, GeoSSA consistently attains the highest solution accuracy and strongest stability. GeoSSA not only exhibits outstanding global optimization performance on standard benchmark functions but also shows strong robustness and generalization ability in practical applications such as UAV path planning and engineering design. Therefore, GeoSSA provides an efficient and reliable solution framework for complex optimization problems."}

However, due to differences in representation and ren dering pipelines, existing studies render meshes and 3DGS separately, making it difficult to accurately handle occlusions and transparency. Moreover, the deformed 3DGS still suffers from visual artifacts due to the sensitivity to the topology quality of the proxy mesh. These issues pose serious obsta cles to the joint use of 3DGS and meshes, making it diffi cult to adapt 3DGS to conventional mesh-oriented graphics pipelines. We propose UniMGS, the first unified framework for rasterizing mesh and 3DGS in a single-pass anti-aliased manner, with a novel binding strategy for 3DGS deformation based on proxy mesh. Our key insight is to blend the col ors of both triangle and Gaussian fragments by anti-aliased α-blending in a single pass, achieving visually coherent re sults with precise handling of occlusion and transparency. To improve the visual appearance of the deformed 3DGS, our Gaussian-centric binding strategy employs a proxy mesh and spatially associates Gaussians with the mesh faces, signifi cantly reducing rendering artifacts. With these two compo nents, UniMGS enables the visualization and manipulation of 3D objects represented by mesh or 3DGS within a unified framework, opening up new possibilities in embodied AI, vir tual reality, and gaming.

Hence, RLHF can be viewed as a form of voting, where the aggregation mechanism is defined by the loss function. Although Arrow's Impossibility Theorem suggests that different mechanisms satisfy different sets of desirable axioms, most existing methods rely on a single aggregation principle, typically the Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model, which corresponds to Borda count voting. This restricts the axiomatic properties of the learned reward and obscures the normative assumptions embedded in optimization. In this work, we introduce Differential Voting, a unifying framework that constructs instance-wise, differentiable loss functions whose population-level optima provably correspond to distinct classical voting rules. We develop differentiable surrogates for majority-based aggregation (BTL), Copeland, and Kemeny rules, and formally analyze their calibration properties, gradient fields, and limiting behavior as smoothing parameters vanish. For each loss, we establish consistency with the corresponding social choice rule and characterize the axioms it satisfies or violates. Our analysis shows how design choices in loss geometry-such as margin sensitivity and boundary concentration-directly translate into normative aggregation behavior. Differential Voting makes preference aggregation an explicit and controllable design choice in RLHF, enabling principled trade-offs between axiomatic guarantees and optimization stability.

Our extensive analysis of ten causal and six masked language models reveals that most models, especially those pre-trained with the masking objective, are overconfident. The best-calibrated scores come from confidence estimates that account for inconsistencies due to statement rephrasing.

While classical correlations are typically regarded as adversarial to privacy, the role of their quantum analogue, entanglement, is not well understood. In this work, we investigate how quantum entanglement fundamentally shapes quantum local differential privacy (QLDP). We consider a bipartite quantum system whose input state has a prescribed level of entanglement, characterized by a lower bound on the entanglement entropy. Each subsystem is then processed by a local quantum mechanism and measured using local operations only, ensuring that no additional entanglement is generated during the process. Our main result reveals a sharp phase-transition phenomenon in the relation between entanglement and QLDP: below a mechanism-dependent entropy threshold, the optimal privacy leakage level mirrors that of unentangled inputs; beyond this threshold, the privacy leakage level decreases with the entropy, which strictly improves privacy guarantees and can even turn some non-private mechanisms into private ones. The phase-transition phenomenon gives rise to a nonlinear dependence of the privacy leakage level on the entanglement entropy, even though the underlying quantum mechanisms and measurements are linear. We show that the transition is governed by the intrinsic non-convex geometry of the set of entanglement-constrained quantum states, which we parametrize as a smooth manifold and analyze via Riemannian optimization. Our findings demonstrate that entanglement serves as a genuine privacy-enhancing resource, offering a geometric and operational foundation for designing robust privacy-preserving quantum protocols."}

However, the increasing deployment of deep learning models has exposed them to various adversarial attacks, including backdoor attacks. This paper presents a novel dynamic mask-based backdoor attack method, specifically designed for object detection models. We exploit a dataset poisoning technique to embed a malicious trigger, rendering any models trained on this compromised dataset vulnerable to our backdoor attack. We particularly focus on a mushroom detection dataset to demonstrate the practical risks posed by such attacks on critical real-life domains. Our work also emphasizes the importance of creating a detailed backdoor attack scenario to illustrate the significant risks associated with the outsourcing practice. Our approach leverages SAM, a recent and powerful image segmentation AI model, to create masks for dynamic trigger placement, introducing a new and stealthy attack method. Through extensive experimentation, we show that our sophisticated attack scenario maintains high accuracy on clean data with the YOLOv7 object detection model while achieving high attack success rates on poisoned samples. Our approach surpasses traditional methods for backdoor injection, which are based on static and consistent patterns. Our findings underscore the urgent need for robust countermeasures to protect deep learning models from these evolving adversarial threats."}

Through an initial evaluation using three conditions-no feedback, weight only, and weight combined with pressure-we examined how these signals affect perceived heaviness, coherence with visual cues, and the perceived urgency of notifications. Our results validate that pressure amplifies the perception of weight, but this increased heaviness does not translate into higher perceived urgency. These findings suggest that while pressure___enhanced weight can enrich haptic rendering of UI elements in VR, its contribution to communicating urgency may require further investigation, alternative pressure profiles, or different types of notifications."}

Traditional search advertising, which relies on static keywords, fails to capture the fleeting, context-dependent user intents--the specific information, goods, or services a user seeks--embedded in conversational flows. Beyond the standard goal of social welfare maximization, effective LLM advertising imposes additional requirements on contextual coherence (ensuring ads align semantically with transient user intents) and computational efficiency (avoiding user interaction latency), as well as adherence to ethical and regulatory standards, including preserving privacy and ensuring explicit ad disclosure. Although various recent solutions have explored bidding on token-level and query-level, both categories of approaches generally fail to holistically satisfy this multifaceted set of constraints.\n  We propose a practical framework that resolves these tensions through two decoupling strategies. First, we decouple ad insertion from response generation to ensure safety and explicit disclosure. Second, we decouple bidding from specific user queries by using ``genres'' (high-level semantic clusters) as a proxy. This allows advertisers to bid on stable categories rather than sensitive real-time response, reducing computational burden and privacy risks. We demonstrate that applying the VCG auction mechanism to this genre-based framework yields approximately dominant strategy incentive compatibility (DSIC) and individual rationality (IR), as well as approximately optimal social welfare, while maintaining high computational efficiency. Finally, we introduce an \"LLM-as-a-Judge\" metric to estimate contextual coherence. Our experiments show that this metric correlates strongly with human ratings (Spearman's $ρ\\approx 0.66$), outperforming 80% of individual human evaluators."}

Based on this insight, we propose flatness, a new metric to quantify this property, and develop the Sample-level-flatness-based Dataset Distillation (SFDD) approach, which filters the training data to retain only the most valuable samples.

This paper introduces \\emph{topological secure aggregation} (TSA), which studies one-shot, information-theoretically secure aggregation of neighboring users' inputs over arbitrary network topologies. We develop a unified linear design framework that characterizes TSA achievability through the spectral properties of the communication graph, specifically the kernel of a diagonally modulated adjacency matrix. For several representative classes of $d$-regular graphs including ring, prism and complete topologies, we establish the optimal communication and secret key rate region. In particular, to securely compute one symbol of the neighborhood sum, each user must (i) store at least one key symbol, (ii) broadcast at least one message symbol, and (iii) collectively, all users must hold at least $d$ i.i.d. key symbols. Notably, this total key requirement depends only on the \\emph{neighborhood size} $d$, independent of the network size, revealing a fundamental limit of SA in decentralized networks with limited local connectivity."}

Recent advances in 3D Morphable Model (3DMM)-based facial reconstruction methods have achieved remarkable high-fidelity face estimation. However, on the one hand, they struggle to capture the entire head, including non-facial regions and background details in real time, which is an essential aspect for producing realistic, high-fidelity head avatars. On the other hand, recent approaches leveraging generative adversarial networks (GANs) for head avatar generation from videos can achieve high-quality reenactments but encounter limitations in reproducing fine-grained head details, such as wrinkles and hair textures. In addition, existing methods generally rely on a large amount of training data, and rarely focus on using only a simple selfie video to achieve avatar reenactment. To address these challenges, this study introduces a method for detailed head avatar reenactment using a selfie video. The approach combines 3DMMs with a StyleGAN-based generator. A detailed reconstruction model is proposed, incorporating mixed loss functions for foreground reconstruction and avatar image generation during adversarial training to recover high-frequency details.

While rendering for such devices is expensive, most of the content falls into peripheral vision, where human perception differs from that in the fovea. Consequently, it is critical to understand and leverage the limitations of visual perception to enable efficient rendering. A standard approach is to exploit the reduced sensitivity to spatial details in the periphery by reducing rendering resolution, so-called foveated rendering. While this strategy avoids rendering part of the content altogether, an alternative promising direction is to replace accurate and expensive rendering with inexpensive synthesis of content that is perceptually indistinguishable from the ground-truth image. In this paper, we propose such a method for the efficient generation of an image signal that substitutes the rendering of high-frequency details. The method is grounded in findings from image statistics, which show that preserving appropriate local statistics is critical for perceived image quality. Based on this insight, we extrapolate several local image statistics from foveated content into higher spatial frequency ranges that are attenuated or omitted in the rendering process. This rich set of statistics is later used to synthesize a signal that is added to the initial rendering, boosting its perceived quality.

Turing's foundational result established the Halting Problem as undecidable, showing that no algorithm can universally determine termination for all programs and inputs. Consequently, automatic verification tools approximate termination, sometimes failing to prove or disprove; these tools rely on problem-specific architectures and abstractions, and are usually tied to particular programming languages. Recent success and progress in large language models (LLMs) raises the following question: can LLMs reliably predict program termination? In this work, we evaluate LLMs on a diverse set of C programs from the Termination category of the International Competition on Software Verification (SV-Comp) 2025. Our results suggest that LLMs perform remarkably well at predicting program termination, where GPT-5 and Claude Sonnet-4.5 would rank just behind the top-ranked tool (using test-time-scaling), and Code World Model (CWM) would place just behind the second-ranked tool. While LLMs are effective at predicting program termination, they often fail to provide a valid witness as a proof. Moreover, LLMs performance drops as program length increases. We hope these insights motivate further research into program termination and the broader potential of LLMs for reasoning about undecidable problems."}

Given that effective platooning relies on robust vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) links, understanding connectivity dynamics on highways is essential.} In this paper, we analyze the dynamics of vehicular platooning on a highway and its impact on the performance of two forms of vehicular communications -- namely V2V and V2I communication -- compared to independent vehicle movement on a highway. The vehicular networks consists of road-side units (RSUs), modeled as a 1D Poisson point process (PPP), to provide the vehicular connectivity to the VUs. VUs are modeled as 1D PPP under the non-platooned traffic scenario (N-PTS) and as a 1D Matern cluster process (MCP) under the platooned traffic scenario (PTS). We evaluate the distribution on the per-RSU load, representing the number of VUs served, for the typical and tagged RSU. Additionally, we derive coverage probability (CP) and rate coverage (RC), which measures the probability of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and achievable rate above a specified threshold at the typical VU along with their meta distribution (MD), providing a deeper understanding of the reliability and variability of these metrics across different spatial distributions of VUs and RSUs. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings through simulations and provide numerical insights into the impact of different traffic patterns on RSU load distribution, CP, and RC performance."}

Manual interpretation from this imagery is labor-intensive and error-prone, underscoring the need for automatic and reliable detection across varying scenes. Yet, such automatic detection is challenging due to severe background heterogeneity, dominant empty terrain (class imbalance), small or occluded targets, and wide variation in density and scale. To make the detection model (HerdNet) more robust to these challenges, a weakly supervised patch-level pretraining based on a detection network's architecture is proposed. The detection dataset includes five caribou herds distributed across Alaska. By learning from empty vs. non-empty labels in this dataset, the approach produces early weakly supervised knowledge for enhanced detection compared to HerdNet, which is initialized from generic weights. Accordingly, the patch-based pretrain network attained high accuracy on multi-herd imagery (2017) and on an independent year's (2019) test sets (F1: 93.7%/92.6%, respectively), enabling reliable mapping of regions containing animals to facilitate manual counting on large aerial imagery. Transferred to detection, initialization from weakly supervised pretraining yielded consistent gains over ImageNet weights on both positive patches (F1: 92.6%/93.5% vs. 89.3%/88.6%), and full-image counting (F1: 95.5%/93.3% vs. 91.5%/90.4%). Remaining limitations are false positives from animal-like background clutter and false negatives related to low animal density occlusions. Overall, pretraining on coarse labels prior to detection makes it possible to rely on weakly-supervised pretrained weights even when labeled data are limited, achieving results comparable to generic-weight initialization."}

Being the new paradigm of neural rendering, Gaussian Splatting has been investigated in many applications, with the main effort in extending its representation, improving its optimization process, and accelerating its speed. However, one orthogonal, much needed, but under-explored area is data uncertainty. In standard 4D Gaussian Splatting, data uncertainty can manifest as view sparsity, missing frames, camera asynchronization, etc. So far, there has been little research to holistically incorporating various types of data uncertainty under a single framework. To this end, we propose Graphical X Splatting, or GraphiXS, a new probabilistic framework that considers multiple types of data uncertainty, aiming for a fundamental augmentation of the current 4D Gaussian Splatting paradigm into a probabilistic setting. GraphiXS is general and can be instantiated with a range of primitives, e.g. Gaussians, Student's-t. Furthermore, GraphiXS can be used to `upgrade' existing methods to accommodate data uncertainty. Through exhaustive evaluation and comparison, we demonstrate that GraphiXS can systematically model various uncertainties in data, outperform existing methods in many settings where data are missing or polluted in space and time, and therefore is a major generalization of the current 4D Gaussian Splatting research."}

However, little attention has been given to the possibility that such models could be exploited to produce harmful research by repurposing open science artefacts for malicious ends. We fill the gap by introducing an end-to-end pipeline that first bypasses LLM safeguards through persuasion-based jailbreaking, then reinterprets NLP papers to identify and repurpose their artefacts (datasets, methods, and tools) by exploiting their vulnerabilities, and finally assesses the safety of these proposals using our evaluation framework across three dimensions: harmfulness, feasibility of misuse, and soundness of technicality. Overall, our findings demonstrate that LLMs can generate harmful proposals by repurposing ethically designed open artefacts; however, we find that LLMs acting as evaluators strongly disagree with one another on evaluation outcomes: GPT-4.1 assigns higher scores (indicating greater potential harms, higher soundness and feasibility of misuse), Gemini-2.5-pro is markedly stricter, and Grok-3 falls between these extremes. This indicates that LLMs cannot yet serve as reliable judges in a malicious evaluation setup, making human evaluation essential for credible dual-use risk assessment."}

By guiding signals through a waveguide and emitting them via a movable pinching antenna, these systems enable dynamic control of signal propagation and spatial adaptability. However, their performance heavily depends on effective resource allocation-encompassing power, bandwidth, and antenna positioning-which becomes challenging under imperfect channel state information (CSI) and user localization uncertainty. Existing studies largely assume perfect CSI or ideal user positioning, while our prior work considered uniform localization errors, an oversimplified assumption. In this paper, we develop a robust resource allocation framework for multiuser downlink pinching antenna systems under Gaussian-distributed localization uncertainty, which more accurately models real-world positioning errors. An energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem is formulated subject to probabilistic outage constraints, and an analytical power allocation strategy is derived under given antenna positions. On this basis, the heuristic particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is employed to identify the antenna position that achieves the global EE configuration. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed scheme greatly enhances both EE and system reliability compared with fixed-antenna benchmark, validating its effectiveness for practical high-frequency wireless deployments."}

However, large-angle redirection is inherently ill-posed: a monocular video captures only a narrow spatio-temporal view of a dynamic 3D scene, providing highly partial observations of the underlying 4D world. The key challenge is therefore to recover a complete and coherent representation from this limited input, with consistent geometry and motion. While recent diffusion-based methods achieve impressive results, they often break down under large-angle viewpoint changes far from the original trajectory, where missing visual grounding leads to severe geometric ambiguity and temporal inconsistency. To address this, we present FreeOrbit4D, an effective training-free framework that tackles this geometric ambiguity by recovering a geometry-complete 4D proxy as structural grounding for video generation. We obtain this proxy by decoupling foreground and background reconstructions: we unproject the monocular video into a static background and geometry-incomplete foreground point clouds in a unified global space, then leverage an object-centric multi-view diffusion model to synthesize multi-view images and reconstruct geometry-complete foreground point clouds in canonical object space. By aligning the canonical foreground point cloud to the global scene space via dense pixel-synchronized 3D--3D correspondences and projecting the geometry-complete 4D proxy onto target camera viewpoints, we provide geometric scaffolds that guide a conditional video diffusion model. Extensive experiments show that FreeOrbit4D produces more faithful redirected videos under challenging large-angle trajectories, and our geometry-complete 4D proxy further opens a potential avenue for practical applications such as edit propagation and 4D data generation. Project page and code will be released soon."}

Across models and languages, we observe consistent behavioral patterns, including incentive-sensitive conditional strategies and cross-linguistic divergence. To interpret these dynamics, we train supervised classifiers on canonical repeated-game strategies and apply them to LLM decisions, revealing systematic, model- and language-dependent behavioral intentions, with linguistic framing sometimes matching or exceeding architectural effects. Our results provide a unified framework for auditing LLMs as strategic agents and highlight cooperation biases with direct implications for AI governance and multi-agent system design."}

The system includes a triples creator that builds structured facts about a concept, a semantic mapper that selects attributes useful for analogy, a stylized generator that turns them into riddle clues, and a validator that collects all possible answers the riddle could point to. We use this validator to study whether large language models can recover the full answer set for different riddle types. Our case study shows that while models often guess the main intended answer, they frequently miss other valid interpretations. This highlights the value of riddles as a lightweight tool for examining reasoning coverage and ambiguity handling in language models."}

However, current approaches predominantly rely on unimodal RGB pre-training, overlooking the complex 3D geometry inherent to surgical environments. Although several architectures support multimodal or geometry-aware inputs in general computer vision, the benefits of incorporating depth information in surgical settings remain underexplored. We conduct a large-scale empirical study comparing eight ViT-based VFMs that differ in pre-training domain, learning objective, and input modality (RGB vs. RGB-D). For pre-training, we use a curated dataset of 1.4 million robotic surgical images paired with depth maps generated from an off-the-shelf network. We evaluate these models under both frozen-backbone and end-to-end fine-tuning protocols across eight surgical datasets spanning object detection, segmentation, depth estimation, and pose estimation. Our experiments yield several consistent findings. Models incorporating explicit geometric tokenization, such as MultiMAE, substantially outperform unimodal baselines across all tasks. Notably, geometric-aware pre-training enables remarkable data efficiency: models fine-tuned on just 25% of labeled data consistently surpass RGB-only models trained on the full dataset. Importantly, these gains require no architectural or runtime changes at inference; depth is used only during pre-training, making adoption straightforward. These findings suggest that multimodal pre-training offers a viable path towards building more capable surgical vision systems."}

WiP generalizes across subjects of varying morphologies, including non-human species, without requiring individual body measurements or shape fitting.

Such setups overlook the multi-dimensional and multi-modal nature of conversational quality, which encompasses semantic coherence, audio naturalness, speaker consistency, emotion alignment, and turn-taking behavior. Moreover, they are fundamentally mismatched with duplex spoken dialogue systems that generate responses incrementally, where agents must make decisions based on partial utterances. We address these limitations with the first multi-reward RLAIF framework for SDS, combining semantic, audio-quality, and emotion-consistency rewards. To align utterance-level preferences with incremental, blockwise decoding in duplex models, we apply turn-level preference sampling and aggregate per-block log-probabilities within a single DPO objective. We present the first systematic study of preference learning for improving SDS quality in both multi-turn Chain-of-Thought and blockwise duplex models, and release a multi-reward DPO dataset to support reproducible research. Experiments show that single-reward RLAIF selectively improves its targeted metric, while joint multi-reward training yields consistent gains across semantic quality and audio naturalness.

In few-shot NVS, where only a few input views are available, existing methods often assume equal importance for all input views relative to the target, leading to suboptimal results.\n  We address this limitation by introducing a camera-weighting mechanism that adjusts the importance of source views based on their relevance to the target. We propose two approaches: a deterministic weighting scheme leveraging geometric properties like Euclidean distance and angular differences, and a cross-attention-based learning scheme that optimizes view weighting. Additionally, models can be further trained with our camera-weighting scheme to refine their understanding of view relevance and enhance synthesis quality. This mechanism is adaptable and can be integrated into various NVS algorithms, improving their ability to synthesize high-quality novel views. Our results demonstrate that adaptive view weighting enhances accuracy and realism, offering a promising direction for improving NVS."}

This study develops an Interval Type-2 Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (IT2-ANFIS) that generates interpretable prediction intervals through fuzzy rule structures.

Validated on Melbourne Water's Eastern Treatment Plant dataset, IT2-ANFIS achieves comparable predictive performance to first order ANFIS with substantially reduced variance across training runs, while providing explainable uncertainty estimates that link prediction confidence directly to operational conditions and input variables."}

The government places a strong emphasis on preserving and promoting the Bahnaric language by making it accessible online and encouraging communication across generations. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence, such as Neural Machine Translation (NMT), have brought about a transformation in translation by improving accuracy and fluency. This, in turn, contributes to the revival of the language through educational efforts, communication, and documentation. Specifically, NMT is pivotal in enhancing accessibility for Bahnaric speakers, making information and content more readily available. Nevertheless, the translation of Vietnamese into Bahnaric faces practical challenges due to resource constraints, especially given the limited resources available for the Bahnaric language. To address this, we employ state-of-the-art techniques in NMT along with two augmentation strategies for domain-specific Vietnamese-Bahnaric translation task. Importantly, both approaches are flexible and can be used with various neural machine translation models. Additionally, they do not require complex data preprocessing steps, the training of additional systems, or the acquisition of extra data beyond the existing training parallel corpora."}

However, large-angle redirection is inherently ill-posed: a monocular video captures only a narrow spatio-temporal view of a dynamic 3D scene, providing highly partial observations of the underlying 4D world. The key challenge is therefore to recover a complete and coherent representation from this limited input, with consistent geometry and motion. While recent diffusion-based methods achieve impressive results, they often break down under large-angle viewpoint changes far from the original trajectory, where missing visual grounding leads to severe geometric ambiguity and temporal inconsistency. To address this, we present FreeOrbit4D, an effective training-free framework that tackles this geometric ambiguity by recovering a geometry-complete 4D proxy as structural grounding for video generation. We obtain this proxy by decoupling foreground and background reconstructions: we unproject the monocular video into a static background and geometry-incomplete foreground point clouds in a unified global space, then leverage an object-centric multi-view diffusion model to synthesize multi-view images and reconstruct geometry-complete foreground point clouds in canonical object space. By aligning the canonical foreground point cloud to the global scene space via dense pixel-synchronized 3D--3D correspondences and projecting the geometry-complete 4D proxy onto target camera viewpoints, we provide geometric scaffolds that guide a conditional video diffusion model. Extensive experiments show that FreeOrbit4D produces more faithful redirected videos under challenging large-angle trajectories, and our geometry-complete 4D proxy further opens a potential avenue for practical applications such as edit propagation and 4D data generation.

We introduce RIFT, Reordered Instruction Following Testbed, to assess instruction following by disentangling structure from content. Using rephrased Jeopardy! question-answer pairs, we test LLMs across two prompt structures: linear prompts, which progress sequentially, and jumping prompts, which preserve identical content but require non-sequential traversal. Across 10,000 evaluations spanning six state-of-the-art open-source LLMs, accuracy dropped by up to 72% under jumping conditions (compared to baseline), revealing a strong dependence on positional continuity. Error analysis shows that approximately 50% of failures stem from instruction-order violations and semantic drift, indicating that current architectures internalize instruction following as a sequential pattern rather than a reasoning skill. These results reveal structural sensitivity as a fundamental limitation in current architectures, with direct implications for applications requiring non-sequential control flow such as workflow automation and multi-agent systems."}

Conformal prediction (CP) is a powerful distribution-free framework for constructing statistically valid prediction intervals. However, standard applications in segmentation often ignore anatomical context, resulting in fragmented, spatially incoherent, and over-segmented prediction sets that limit clinical utility. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes Random-Walk Conformal Prediction (RW-CP), a model-agnostic framework which can be added on top of any segmentation method. RW-CP enforces spatial coherence to generate anatomically valid sets. Our method constructs a k-nearest neighbour graph from pre-trained vision foundation model features and applies a random walk to diffuse uncertainty. The random walk diffusion regularizes the non-conformity scores, making the prediction sets less sensitive to the conformal calibration parameter $λ$, ensuring more stable and continuous anatomical boundaries. RW-CP maintains rigorous marginal coverage while significantly improving segmentation quality. Evaluations on multi-modal public datasets show improvements of up to $35.4\\%$ compared to standard CP baselines, given an allowable error rate of $α=0.1$."}

While Neural Theorem Proving (NTP) has achieved significant success in mathematical competitions, demonstrating the potential of machine learning approaches to formal reasoning, its application to program verification--particularly VC proving--remains largely unexplored. Despite existing work on annotation synthesis and verification-related theorem proving, no benchmark has specifically targeted this fundamental bottleneck: automated VC proving. This work introduces Neural Theorem Proving for Verification Conditions (NTP4VC), presenting the first real-world multi-language benchmark for this task. From real-world projects such as Linux and Contiki-OS kernel, our benchmark leverages industrial pipelines (Why3 and Frama-C) to generate semantically equivalent test cases across formal languages of Isabelle, Lean, and Rocq. We evaluate large language models (LLMs), both general-purpose and those fine-tuned for theorem proving, on NTP4VC.

To bridge the gap, we first propose the CONTEXT-VQA (i.e., Conflicting Text) dataset, consisting of image-question pairs together with systematically generated persuasive prompts that deliberately conflict with visual evidence. Then, a thorough evaluation framework is designed and executed to benchmark the susceptibility of various models to these conflicting multimodal inputs. Comprehensive experiments over 11 state-of-the-art VLMs reveal that these models are indeed vulnerable to misleading textual prompts, often overriding clear visual evidence in favor of the conflicting text, and show an average performance drop of over 48.2% after only one round of persuasive conversation. Our findings highlight a critical limitation in current VLMs and underscore the need for improved robustness against textual manipulation."}

Understanding how these associations are learned and represented in language models is essential for connecting deep learning with linguistic theory and developing a mechanistic foundation for large language models. In this work, we analyze how these associations emerge from natural language data in attention-based language models through the lens of training dynamics. By leveraging a leading-term approximation of the gradients, we develop closed-form expressions for the weights at early stages of training that explain how semantic associations first take shape. Through our analysis, we reveal that each set of weights of the transformer has closed-form expressions as simple compositions of three basis functions (bigram, token-interchangeability, and context mappings), reflecting the statistics of the text corpus and uncovering how each component of the transformer captures semantic associations based on these compositions. Experiments on real-world LLMs demonstrate that our theoretical weight characterizations closely match the learned weights, and qualitative analyses further show how our theorem shines light on interpreting the learned associations in transformers."}

This framework utilizes a conditional Diffusion Transformer (DiT) to directly model the probability manifold of the state, enabling its generation and editing. The structural nature of this representation is validated through t-SNE visualizations and controlled generation experiments. After successfully uncovering and modeling the state's representational potential, we further propose a novel hybrid architecture that combines the local advantages of RNNs with global context adaptability. This architecture features a parallel DiT that processes a variable-length global context to dynamically generate and adjust the core recurrent module's WKV parameters, transforming the fixed recurrence mechanism into a context-aware dynamic function. Experiments demonstrate that this hybrid model can be trained stably via a multi-objective loss, validating its design feasibility.

To address this, we propose LAIN(Length-Adaptive Interest Network), a plug-and-play framework that explicitly incorporates sequence length as a conditioning signal to balance long- and short-sequence modeling. LAIN consists of three lightweight components: a Spectral Length Encoder that maps length into continuous representations, Length-Conditioned Prompting that injects global contextual cues into both long- and short-term behavior branches, and Length-Modulated Attention that adaptively adjusts attention sharpness based on sequence length. Extensive experiments on three real-world benchmarks across five strong CTR backbones show that LAIN consistently improves overall performance, achieving up to 1.15% AUC gain and 2.25% log loss reduction.

However, existing KG-based RAG approaches rely on semantics-unaware path sampling and are weakly aligned with KG reasoning objectives, which limits further accuracy gains. They also feed retrieved paths directly into the reasoner without organizing them into answer-centered reasoning paths, hindering small LLMs' ability to leverage the retrieved knowledge. Furthermore, prior works predominantly rely on large LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT/GPT-4) or assume backbones above 7B parameters, leaving sub-7B models underexplored. We address this gap with RPO-RAG, the first KG-based RAG framework specifically designed for small LLMs, to the best of our knowledge. RPO-RAG introduces three key innovations: (1) a query-path semantic sampling strategy that provides informative supervisory signals; (2) a relation-aware preference optimization that aligns training with intermediate KG reasoning signals (e.g., relation); and (3) an answer-centered prompt design that organizes entities and reasoning paths in an interpretable format. Extensive experiments on two benchmark Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) datasets, WebQSP and CWQ, demonstrate that RPO-RAG effectively bridges the performance gap between small and large language models. On WebQSP, it improves F1 by up to 8.8%, reflecting enhanced answer precision, while on CWQ it achieves new state-of-the-art results among models under 8B parameters in both Hit and F1. Overall, RPO-RAG substantially improves the reasoning capability of small LLMs, even under 3B parameters-highlighting their potential for resource-efficient and practical on-device KGQA applications."}

Code is available at https://github.com/Luffy03/GF-Screen", "summary": "Pan-cancer screening in large-scale CT scans remains challenging for existing AI methods, primarily due to the difficulty of localizing diverse types of tiny lesions in large CT volumes. The extreme foreground-background imbalance significantly hinders models from focusing on diseased regions, while redundant focus on healthy regions not only decreases the efficiency but also increases false positives. Inspired by radiologists' glance and focus diagnostic strategy, we introduce GF-Screen, a Glance and Focus reinforcement learning framework for pan-cancer screening. GF-Screen employs a Glance model to localize the diseased regions and a Focus model to precisely segment the lesions, where segmentation results of the Focus model are leveraged to reward the Glance model via Reinforcement Learning (RL). Specifically, the Glance model crops a group of sub-volumes from the entire CT volume and learns to select the sub-volumes with lesions for the Focus model to segment. Given that the selecting operation is non-differentiable for segmentation training, we propose to employ the segmentation results to reward the Glance model. To optimize the Glance model, we introduce a novel group relative learning paradigm, which employs group relative comparison to prioritize high-advantage predictions and discard low-advantage predictions within sub-volume groups, not only improving efficiency but also reducing false positives. In this way, for the first time, we effectively extend cutting-edge RL techniques to tackle the specific challenges in pan-cancer screening. Extensive experiments on 16 internal and 7 external datasets across 9 lesion types demonstrated the effectiveness of GF-Screen. Notably, GF-Screen leads the public validation leaderboard of MICCAI FLARE25 pan-cancer challenge, surpassing the FLARE24 champion solution by a large margin (+25.6% DSC and +28.2% NSD)."}

Fundamentally, this constitutes a reasoning process composed of \\textit{hypothesis-verification cycles}, requiring models to possess both geospatial reasoning capabilities and the ability to verify evidence against geographic facts. Existing methods typically internalize location knowledge and reasoning patterns into static memory via supervised training or trajectory-based reinforcement fine-tuning. Consequently, these methods are prone to factual hallucinations and generalization bottlenecks in open-world settings or scenarios requiring dynamic knowledge. To address these challenges, we propose a Hierarchical Localization Agent, called LocationAgent. Our core philosophy is to retain hierarchical reasoning logic within the model while offloading the verification of geographic evidence to external tools. To implement hierarchical reasoning, we design the RER architecture (Reasoner-Executor-Recorder), which employs role separation and context compression to prevent the drifting problem in multi-step reasoning. For evidence verification, we construct a suite of clue exploration tools that provide diverse evidence to support location reasoning. Furthermore, to address data leakage and the scarcity of Chinese data in existing datasets, we introduce CCL-Bench (China City Location Bench), an image geolocation benchmark encompassing various scene granularities and difficulty levels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LocationAgent significantly outperforms existing methods by at least 30\\% in zero-shot settings."}

In this work, we introduce a simple pipeline for creating and evaluating analogy-based riddles. The system includes a triples creator that builds structured facts about a concept, a semantic mapper that selects attributes useful for analogy, a stylized generator that turns them into riddle clues, and a validator that collects all possible answers the riddle could point to. We use this validator to study whether large language models can recover the full answer set for different riddle types. Our case study shows that while models often guess the main intended answer, they frequently miss other valid interpretations. This highlights the value of riddles as a lightweight tool for examining reasoning coverage and ambiguity handling in language models."}

By refining the predictions of pre-trained models at inference, our method delivers significantly improved registration accuracy at a modest computational cost, requiring only 21% additional inference time (0.56s). We evaluate Reg-TTR on two distinct tasks and show that it achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance while maintaining inference speeds close to previous deep learning methods. As foundation models continue to emerge, our framework offers an efficient strategy to narrow the performance gap between registration foundation models and SOTA methods trained on specialized datasets.

We present \\model{}, a multi-agent framework that formulates procedural graph extraction as a multi-round reasoning process with dedicated structural and logical refinement. The framework iterates through three stages: (1) a graph extraction phase with the graph builder agent, (2) a structural feedback phase in which a simulation agent diagnoses and explains structural defects, and (3) a logical feedback phase in which a semantic agent aligns semantics between flow logic and linguistic cues in the source text. Important feedback is prioritized and expressed in natural language, which is injected into subsequent prompts, enabling interpretable and controllable refinement. This modular design allows agents to target distinct error types without supervision or parameter updates. Experiments demonstrate that \\model{} achieves substantial improvements in both structural correctness and logical consistency over strong baselines."}

Inspired by diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs), we propose DART, which leverages parallel generation to reduce drafting latency. DART predicts logits for multiple future masked positions in parallel within a single forward pass based on hidden states of the target model, thereby eliminating autoregressive rollouts in the draft model while preserving a lightweight design. Based on these parallel logit predictions, we further introduce an efficient tree pruning algorithm that constructs high-quality draft token trees with N-gram-enforced semantic continuity. DART substantially reduces draft-stage overhead while preserving high draft accuracy, leading to significantly improved end-to-end decoding speed. Experimental results demonstrate that DART achieves a 2.03x--3.44x wall-clock time speedup across multiple datasets, surpassing EAGLE3 by 30% on average and offering a practical speculative decoding framework.

We propose FBSDiff, a novel framework adapting off-the-shelf T2I diffusion model into the I2I paradigm from a fresh frequency-domain perspective. Through dynamic frequency band substitution of diffusion features, FBSDiff realizes versatile and highly controllable text-driven I2I in a plug-and-play manner (without need for model training, fine-tuning, or online optimization), allowing appearance-guided, layout-guided, and contour-guided I2I translation by progressively substituting low-frequency band, mid-frequency band, and high-frequency band of latent diffusion features, respectively. In addition, FBSDiff flexibly enables continuous control over I2I correlation intensity simply by tuning the bandwidth of the substituted frequency band. To further promote image translation efficiency, flexibility, and functionality, we propose FBSDiff++ which improves upon FBSDiff mainly in three aspects: (1) accelerate inference speed by a large margin (8.9$\\times$ speedup in inference) with refined model architecture; (2) improve the Frequency Band Substitution module to allow for input source images of arbitrary resolution and aspect ratio; (3) extend model functionality to enable localized image manipulation and style-specific content creation with only subtle adjustments to the core method. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments verify superiority of FBSDiff++ in I2I translation visual quality, efficiency, versatility, and controllability compared to related advanced approaches."}

Mainstream models leverage the Transformer attention mechanism to improve performance, but its computational complexity grows with the sequence length, leading to a latency challenge for long sequences. Consequently, KV cache technology has recently been explored in sequential recommendation systems to reduce inference latency. However, KV cache introduces substantial storage overhead in sequential recommendation systems, which often have a large user base with potentially very long user history sequences. In this work, we observe that KV sequences across different users exhibit significant similarities, indicating the existence of collaborative signals in KV. Furthermore, we analyze the KV using singular value decomposition (SVD) and find that the information in KV can be divided into two parts: the majority of the information is shareable across users, while a small portion is user-specific. Motivated by this, we propose CollectiveKV, a cross-user KV sharing mechanism. It captures the information shared across users through a learnable global KV pool. During inference, each user retrieves high-dimensional shared KV from the pool and concatenates them with low-dimensional user-specific KV to obtain the final KV. Experiments on five sequential recommendation models and three datasets show that our method can compress the KV cache to only 0.8% of its original size, while maintaining or even enhancing model performance."}

However, their high-dimensionality, heterogeneity, and sparsity make clinical prediction challenging. Large Language Models (LLMs) allowed progress towards addressing this challenge by leveraging parametric medical knowledge to enhance EHR data for clinical prediction tasks. Despite the significant achievements made so far, most of the existing approaches are fundamentally task-agnostic in the sense that they deploy LLMs as EHR encoders or EHR completion modules without fully integrating signals from the prediction tasks. This naturally hinders task performance accuracy. In this work, we propose Rewrite-To-Predict (ReToP), an LLM-based framework that addresses this limitation through an end-to-end training of an EHR rewriter and a clinical predictor. To cope with the lack of EHR rewrite training data, we generate synthetic pseudo-labels using clinical-driven feature selection strategies to create diverse patient rewrites for fine-tuning the EHR rewriter. ReToP aligns the rewriter with prediction objectives using a novel Classifier Supervised Contribution (CSC) score that enables the EHR rewriter to generate clinically relevant rewrites that directly enhance prediction. Our ReToP framework surpasses strong baseline models across three clinical tasks on MIMIC-IV. Moreover, the analysis of ReToP shows its generalizability to unseen datasets and tasks with minimal fine-tuning while preserving faithful rewrites and emphasizing task-relevant predictive features."}

Most domain generalization (DG) methods based on domain adversarial learning (DAL) pay much attention to learn domain-invariant information, but often overlook the potential non-causal factors. We unveil two critical causes: 1) The domain discriminator-based DAL method is subject to the extremely sparse domain label, i.e., assigning only one domain label to each dataset, thus can only associate explicit non-causal factor, which is incredibly limited. 2) The non-causal factors, induced by unidentified data bias, are excessively implicit and cannot be solely discerned by conventional DAL paradigm. Based on these key findings, inspired by the Granular-Ball perspective, we propose an improved DAL method, i.e., GB-DAL. The proposed GB-DAL utilizes Prototype-based Granular Ball Splitting (PGBS) module to generate more dense domains from limited datasets, akin to more fine-grained granular balls, indicating more potential non-causal factors. Inspired by adversarial perturbations akin to non-causal factors, we propose a Simulated Non-causal Factors (SNF) module as a means of data augmentation to reduce the implicitness of non-causal factors, and facilitate the training of GB-DAL.

We introduce MetaGen, a training-free framework that adapts both the role space and the collaboration topology at inference time, without updating base model weights. MetaGen generates and rewrites query-conditioned role specifications to maintain a controllable dynamic role pool, then instantiates a constrained execution graph around a minimal backbone. During execution, it iteratively updates role prompts and adjusts structural decisions using lightweight feedback signals.

Existing frequency-based re-weighting methods address statistical imbalance but cannot resolve geometric ambiguity. We propose spatial context constraints that leverage neighborhood prediction consistency to disambiguate locally similar structures. Our approach extends the Class-Balanced (CB) Loss framework with two architecture-agnostic mechanisms: (1) Boundary-CB, an entropy-based constraint that emphasizes ambiguous boundaries, and (2) Density-CB, a density-based constraint that compensates for scan-dependent variations. Both integrate as plug-and-play modules without network modifications, requiring only loss function replacement. On the Industrial3D dataset (610M points from water treatment facilities), our method achieves 55.74% mIoU with 21.7% relative improvement on tail-class performance (29.59% vs. 24.32% baseline) while preserving head-class accuracy (88.14%). Components with primitive-sharing ambiguity show dramatic gains: reducer improves from 0% to 21.12% IoU; valve improves by 24.3% relative.

F-1 first formulates governing equations from problem descriptions, then selects a solving strategy among CoT, PoT, or direct computation based on the generated equations, all within a single LLM call. Results across five models and four benchmarks show F-1 outperforms CoT by +5.76% and PoT by +8.42% on average.

To avoid manual editing, we propose a pseudo-ground truth generator guided by CLIP, which is fine-tuned to automatically identify exposure situations and instruct the tailored corrections. Also, we leverage the rich priors from the FastSAM and CLIP to develop a semantic-prompt consistency loss to enforce semantic consistency and image-prompt alignment for unsupervised training. Comprehensive experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of our method in correcting real-world exposure images and outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods both numerically and visually."}

Compositional methods improve interpretability, but most rely on a single agent or hand-crafted pipeline and cannot decide when to collaborate across complementary agents or compete among overlapping ones. We introduce MATA (Multi-Agent hierarchical Trainable Automaton), a multi-agent system presented as a hierarchical finite-state automaton for visual reasoning whose top-level transitions are chosen by a trainable hyper agent. Each agent corresponds to a state in the hyper automaton, and runs a small rule-based sub-automaton for reliable micro-control. All agents read and write a shared memory, yielding transparent execution history. To supervise the hyper agent's transition policy, we build transition-trajectory trees and transform to memory-to-next-state pairs, forming the MATA-SFT-90K dataset for supervised finetuning (SFT). The finetuned LLM as the transition policy understands the query and the capacity of agents, and it can efficiently choose the optimal agent to solve the task. Across multiple visual reasoning benchmarks, MATA achieves the state-of-the-art results compared with monolithic and compositional baselines.

However, its reliability is increasingly threatened by test set contamination, where test samples or their close variants leak into training data and artificially inflate reported performance. To address this issue, prior work has explored two main lines of mitigation. One line attempts to identify and remove contaminated benchmark items before evaluation, but this inevitably alters the evaluation set itself and becomes unreliable when contamination is moderate or severe. The other line preserves the benchmark and instead suppresses contaminated behavior at evaluation time; however, such interventions often interfere with normal inference and lead to noticeable performance degradation on clean inputs. We propose DeconIEP, a decontamination framework that operates entirely during evaluation by applying small, bounded perturbations in the input embedding space. Guided by a relatively less-contaminated reference model, DeconIEP learns an instance-adaptive perturbation generator that steers the evaluated model away from memorization-driven shortcut pathways. Across multiple open-weight LLMs and benchmarks, extensive empirical results show that DeconIEP achieves strong decontamination effectiveness while incurring only minimal degradation in benign utility."}

Existing hallucination detection methods achieve strong performance when the training and test data come from the same domain, but they suffer from poor cross-domain generalization. In this paper, we study an important yet overlooked problem, termed generalizable hallucination detection (GHD), which aims to train hallucination detectors on data from a single domain while ensuring robust performance across diverse related domains. In studying GHD, we simulate multi-turn dialogues following LLMs initial response and observe an interesting phenomenon: hallucination-initiated multi-turn dialogues universally exhibit larger uncertainty fluctuations than factual ones across different domains. Based on the phenomenon, we propose a new score SpikeScore, which quantifies abrupt fluctuations in multi-turn dialogues. Through both theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we demonstrate that SpikeScore achieves strong cross-domain separability between hallucinated and non-hallucinated responses. Experiments across multiple LLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that the SpikeScore-based detection method outperforms representative baselines in cross-domain generalization and surpasses advanced generalization-oriented methods, verifying the effectiveness of our method in cross-domain hallucination detection."}

We propose the Global Verifier (GLOVE), a framework that introduces a new design dimension for LLM memory systems by establishing a relative notion of truth.

Although recent large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong translation capabilities, their effectiveness for APE--especially under document-level context--remains insufficiently understood. We present a systematic comparison of proprietary and open-weight LLMs under a naive document-level prompting setup, analyzing APE quality, contextual behavior, robustness, and efficiency.\n  Our results show that proprietary LLMs achieve near human-level APE quality even with simple one-shot prompting, regardless of whether document context is provided. While these models exhibit higher robustness to data poisoning attacks than open-weight counterparts, this robustness also reveals a limitation: they largely fail to exploit document-level context for contextual error correction. Furthermore, standard automatic metrics do not reliably reflect these qualitative improvements, highlighting the continued necessity of human evaluation. Despite their strong performance, the substantial cost and latency overheads of proprietary LLMs render them impractical for real-world APE deployment.

To address these limitations, we start by investigating the intrinsic properties of AEs, which reveals that AEs exhibit severe feature inconsistency under progressive frequency attenuation. We further attribute this to the model's inherent spectral bias. Leveraging this insight, we propose an efficient test-time defense named Contrastive Spectral Rectification (CSR). CSR optimizes a rectification perturbation to realign the input with the natural manifold under a spectral-guided contrastive objective, which is applied input-adaptively.

This is particularly important because debunking false information typically takes longer to reach consumers than the misinformation itself; accelerating corrections through automation can therefore help counter it more effectively. Although many organizations perform manual fact-checking, this approach is difficult to scale given the growing volume of digital content. These limitations have motivated interest in automating fact-checking, where identifying claims is a crucial first step. However, progress has been uneven across languages, with English dominating due to abundant annotated data. Portuguese, like other languages, still lacks accessible, licensed datasets, limiting research, NLP developments and applications. In this paper, we introduce ClaimPT, a dataset of European Portuguese news articles annotated for factual claims, comprising 1,308 articles and 6,875 individual annotations. Unlike most existing resources based on social media or parliamentary transcripts, ClaimPT focuses on journalistic content, collected through a partnership with LUSA, the Portuguese News Agency.

To address this issue, we analyze the impact of different segments of the reasoning path on the correctness of the final result and, based on these insights, propose Reinforcement Fine-Tuning with Partial Reasoning Optimization (RPO), a plug-and-play reinforcement fine-tuning algorithm. Unlike traditional reinforcement fine-tuning algorithms that generate full reasoning paths, RPO trains the model by generating suffixes of the reasoning path using experience cache. During the rollout phase of training, RPO reduces token generation in this phase by approximately 95%, greatly lowering the theoretical time overhead. Compared with full-path reinforcement fine-tuning algorithms, RPO reduces the training time of the 1.5B model by 90% and the 7B model by 72%. At the same time, it can be integrated with typical algorithms such as GRPO and DAPO, enabling them to achieve training acceleration while maintaining performance comparable to the original algorithms.

Structured pruning methods are primarily employed to improve the inference efficiency of pre-trained models. Meanwhile, they often require additional time and memory for training, knowledge distillation, structure search, and other strategies, making efficient model fine-tuning challenging to achieve. To simultaneously enhance the training and inference efficiency of downstream task fine-tuning, we introduce GradPruner, which can prune layers of LLMs guided by gradients in the early stages of fine-tuning. GradPruner uses the cumulative gradients of each parameter during the initial phase of fine-tuning to compute the Initial Gradient Information Accumulation Matrix (IGIA-Matrix) to assess the importance of layers and perform pruning. We sparsify the pruned layers based on the IGIA-Matrix and merge them with the remaining layers. Only elements with the same sign are merged to reduce interference from sign variations. We conducted extensive experiments on two LLMs across eight downstream datasets. Including medical, financial, and general benchmark tasks. The results demonstrate that GradPruner has achieved a parameter reduction of 40% with only a 0.99% decrease in accuracy. Our code is publicly available."}

Moreover, automating the purification process helps reduce the risk of worker harm by limiting human involvement. Crude oil contains acidic components such as hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide, and other chemical compounds. During processing, these substances are partially released into sour water. If not properly treated, sour water poses serious environmental threats and accelerates the corrosion of pipelines and equipment. This paper presents a fuzzy expert system, combined with a custom-generated digital twin, developed from a documented industrial process to maintain key parameters at desired levels by mimicking human reasoning. The control strategy is designed to be simple and intuitive, allowing junior or non-expert personnel to interact with the system effectively. The digital twin was developed using Honeywell UniSim Design R492 to simulate real industrial behavior accurately. Valve dynamics were modeled through system identification in MATLAB, and real-time data exchange between the simulator and controller was established using OPC DA. The fuzzy controller applies split-range control to two valves and was tested under 21 different initial pressure conditions using five distinct defuzzification strategies, resulting in a total of 105 unique test scenarios. System performance was evaluated using both error-based metrics (MSE, RMSE, MAE, IAE, ISE, ITAE) and dynamic response metrics, including overshoot, undershoot, rise time, fall time, settling time, and steady-state error. A web-based simulation interface was developed in Python using the Streamlit framework. Although demonstrated here for sour water treatment, the proposed fuzzy expert system is general-purpose."}

As challenges remain in extracting 3D modal features and bridging the gap between different modalities, we propose TIGaussian, a framework that harnesses 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) characteristics to strengthen cross-modality alignment through multi-branch 3DGS tokenizer and modality-specific 3D feature alignment strategies. Specifically, our multi-branch 3DGS tokenizer decouples the intrinsic properties of 3DGS structures into compact latent representations, enabling more generalizable feature extraction. To further bridge the modality gap, we develop a bidirectional cross-modal alignment strategies: a multi-view feature fusion mechanism that leverages diffusion priors to resolve perspective ambiguity in image-3D alignment, while a text-3D projection module adaptively maps 3D features to text embedding space for better text-3D alignment. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of TIGaussian in multiple tasks."}

Each problem was audited to ensure LaTeX compilability, solvability and verifiability, which involved adding missing figures or information, labeling problems requiring a proof, estimation or image, and removing clutter. This process significantly reduces dataset-induced noise, thereby providing a more precise assessment of model performance. The annotated dataset also allows us to evaluate judge-induced noise by comparing GPT-5 mini with the original Omni-Judge, revealing substantial discrepancies between judges on both the clean and tagged problem subsets. Expert annotations reveal that Omni-Judge is wrong in $96.4\\%$ of the judge disagreements, indicating its inability to differentiate between models' abilities, even well before saturation of the benchmark occurs.

In this paper, we conduct a systematic evaluation of handcrafted descriptors, including raw pixels, color histograms, Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), Local Binary Patterns (LBP), Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), and wavelet features, on the CIFAKE dataset of real versus synthetic images. Using 50,000 training and 10,000 test samples, we benchmark seven classifiers ranging from Logistic Regression to advanced gradient-boosted ensembles (LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost). Results demonstrate that LightGBM consistently outperforms alternatives, achieving PR-AUC 0.9879, ROC-AUC 0.9878, F1 0.9447, and a Brier score of 0.0414 with mixed features, representing strong gains in calibration and discrimination over simpler descriptors. Across three configurations (baseline, advanced, mixed), performance improves monotonically, confirming that combining diverse handcrafted features yields substantial benefit.

However, scaling such refinement to naturalistic NLI remains difficult: long, syntactically rich inputs and deep multi-step arguments amplify autoformalisation errors, where a single local mismatch can invalidate the proof. Moreover, current methods often handle failures via costly global regeneration due to the difficulty of localising the responsible span or step from prover diagnostics. Aiming to address these problems, we propose a decompose-and-formalise framework that (i) decomposes premise-hypothesis pairs into an entailment tree of atomic steps, (ii) verifies the tree bottom-up to isolate failures to specific nodes, and (iii) performs local diagnostic-guided refinement instead of regenerating the whole explanation. Moreover, to improve faithfulness of autoformalisation, we introduce $θ$-substitution in an event-based logical form to enforce consistent argument-role bindings. Across a range of reasoning tasks using five LLM backbones, our method achieves the highest explanation verification rates, improving over the state-of-the-art by 26.2%, 21.7%, 21.6% and 48.9%, while reducing refinement iterations and runtime and preserving strong NLI accuracy."}

To overcome this limitation, we introduce a multi-view consistency framework, which includes two views for training strongly augmented data. One is a debiasing strategy for correcting class-wise prediction probabilities according to the prediction performance of the model. The other involves leveraging pseudo-negative labels derived from the model predictions. Furthermore, we introduce a cross-domain affinity learning aimed at aligning features of the same class across different domains, thereby enhancing overall performance.

Existing efforts to characterise agentic design patterns often lack a rigorous systems-theoretic foundation, resulting in high-level or convenience-based taxonomies that are difficult to implement. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a principled methodology for engineering robust AI agents. We propose two primary contributions: first, a novel system-theoretic framework that deconstructs an agentic AI system into five core, interacting functional subsystems: Reasoning & World Model, Perception & Grounding, Action Execution, Learning & Adaptation, and Inter-Agent Communication. Second, derived from this architecture and directly mapped to a comprehensive taxonomy of agentic challenges, we present a collection of 12 agentic design patterns. These patterns - categorised as Foundational, Cognitive & Decisional, Execution & Interaction, and Adaptive & Learning - offer reusable, structural solutions to recurring problems in agent design. The utility of the framework is demonstrated by a case study on the ReAct framework, showing how the proposed patterns can rectify systemic architectural deficiencies.

Despite these advantages, there is a critical instability in DLMs: the moving sink phenomenon. Our analysis indicates that sink tokens exhibit low-norm representations in the Transformer's value space, and that the moving sink phenomenon serves as a protective mechanism in DLMs to prevent excessive information mixing. However, their unpredictable positions across diffusion steps undermine inference robustness. To resolve this, we propose a simple but effective extra sink token implemented via a modified attention mask. Specifically, we introduce a special token constrained to attend solely to itself, while remaining globally visible to all other tokens.

However, monocular camera-based 3D detection suffers from depth ambiguity and reduced robustness under challenging conditions. Radar provides complementary advantages such as resilience to poor lighting and adverse weather, but its sparsity and low resolution limit its direct use in detection frameworks. This motivates the need for effective Radar-camera fusion with improved preprocessing and depth estimation strategies. We propose an end-to-end framework that enhances monocular 3D object detection through two key components. First, we introduce InstaRadar, an instance segmentation-guided expansion method that leverages pre-trained segmentation masks to enhance Radar density and semantic alignment, producing a more structured representation. InstaRadar achieves state-of-the-art results in Radar-guided depth estimation, showing its effectiveness in generating high-quality depth features. Second, we integrate the pre-trained RCDPT into the BEVDepth framework as a replacement for its depth module. With InstaRadar-enhanced inputs, the RCDPT integration consistently improves 3D detection performance. Overall, these components yield steady gains over the baseline BEVDepth model, demonstrating the effectiveness of InstaRadar and the advantage of explicit depth supervision in 3D object detection. Although the framework lags behind Radar-camera fusion models that directly extract BEV features, since Radar serves only as guidance rather than an independent feature stream, this limitation highlights potential for improvement. Future work will extend InstaRadar to point cloud-like representations and integrate a dedicated Radar branch with temporal cues for enhanced BEV fusion."}

However, existing activation safety approaches, trained on broad misuse datasets, struggle with poor precision, limited flexibility, and lack of interpretability. This paper introduces a new paradigm: rule-based activation safety, inspired by rule-sharing practices in cybersecurity. We propose modeling activations as cognitive elements (CEs), fine-grained, interpretable factors such as ''making a threat'' and ''payment processing'', that can be composed to capture nuanced, domain-specific behaviors with higher precision. Building on this representation, we present a practical framework that defines predicate rules over CEs and detects violations in real time. This enables practitioners to configure and update safeguards without retraining models or detectors, while supporting transparency and auditability. Our results show that compositional rule-based activation safety improves precision, supports domain customization, and lays the groundwork for scalable, interpretable, and auditable AI governance. We will release GAVEL as an open-source framework and provide an accompanying automated rule creation tool."}

We ask whether LLMs can be systematically manipulated to reproduce language-production impairments characteristic of aphasia following focal brain lesions. Such models could provide scalable proxies for testing rehabilitation hypotheses, and offer a controlled framework for probing the functional organization of language. We introduce a clinically grounded, component-level framework that simulates aphasia by selectively perturbing functional components in LLMs, and apply it to both modular Mixture-of-Experts models and dense Transformers using a unified intervention interface. Our pipeline (i) identifies subtype-linked components for Broca's and Wernicke's aphasia, (ii) interprets these components with linguistic probing tasks, and (iii) induces graded impairments by progressively perturbing the top-k subtype-linked components, evaluating outcomes with Western Aphasia Battery (WAB) subtests summarized by Aphasia Quotient (AQ). Across architectures and lesioning strategies, subtype-targeted perturbations yield more systematic, aphasia-like regressions than size-matched random perturbations, and MoE modularity supports more localized and interpretable phenotype-to-component mappings. These findings suggest that modular LLMs, combined with clinically informed component perturbations, provide a promising platform for simulating aphasic language production and studying how distinct language functions degrade under targeted disruptions."}

Conventional training treats all pixels equally, leading to unstable optimization during early epochs when predictions are unreliable. We argue that this instability hinders convergence toward Pareto-optimal solutions and propose a region-wise curriculum strategy that prioritizes learning from certain regions and gradually incorporates uncertain ones, reducing gradient variance. Methodologically, we introduce a Pareto-consistent loss that balances trade-offs between regional uncertainties by adaptively reshaping the loss landscape and constraining convergence dynamics between interior and boundary regions; this guides the model toward Pareto-approximate solutions. To address boundary ambiguity, we further develop a fuzzy labeling mechanism that maintains binary confidence in non-boundary areas while enabling smooth transitions near boundaries, stabilizing gradients, and expanding flat regions in the loss surface. Experiments on brain metastasis and non-metastatic tumor segmentation show consistent improvements across multiple configurations, with our method outperforming traditional crisp-set approaches in all tumor subregions."}

In this work, we address these challenges with a recommendation model that leverages the structure of psychometric data to provide visual explanations that are faithful to the model and interpretable by care professionals. We focus on a narrow healthcare niche, gerontological primary care, to show that the proposed recommendation model can assist the attending professional in the creation of personalised care plans.

Recent advances in AI, particularly chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, approximate such human cognitive abilities, where world models are believed to be embedded within large language models. Expert-level performance in formal and abstract domains such as mathematics and programming has been achieved in current systems by relying predominantly on verbal reasoning. However, they still lag far behind humans in domains like physical and spatial intelligence, which require richer representations and prior knowledge. The emergence of unified multimodal models (UMMs) capable of both verbal and visual generation has therefore sparked interest in more human-like reasoning grounded in complementary multimodal pathways, though their benefits remain unclear. From a world-model perspective, this paper presents the first principled study of when and how visual generation benefits reasoning. Our key position is the visual superiority hypothesis: for certain tasks--particularly those grounded in the physical world--visual generation more naturally serves as world models, whereas purely verbal world models encounter bottlenecks arising from representational limitations or insufficient prior knowledge. Theoretically, we formalize internal world modeling as a core component of CoT reasoning and analyze distinctions among different forms of world models. Empirically, we identify tasks that necessitate interleaved visual-verbal CoT reasoning, constructing a new evaluation suite, VisWorld-Eval. Controlled experiments on a state-of-the-art UMM show that interleaved CoT significantly outperforms purely verbal CoT on tasks that favor visual world modeling, but offers no clear advantage otherwise. Together, this work clarifies the potential of multimodal world modeling for more powerful, human-like multimodal AI."}

Hence, RLHF can be viewed as a form of voting, where the aggregation mechanism is defined by the loss function. Although Arrow's Impossibility Theorem suggests that different mechanisms satisfy different sets of desirable axioms, most existing methods rely on a single aggregation principle, typically the Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model, which corresponds to Borda count voting. This restricts the axiomatic properties of the learned reward and obscures the normative assumptions embedded in optimization. In this work, we introduce Differential Voting, a unifying framework that constructs instance-wise, differentiable loss functions whose population-level optima provably correspond to distinct classical voting rules. We develop differentiable surrogates for majority-based aggregation (BTL), Copeland, and Kemeny rules, and formally analyze their calibration properties, gradient fields, and limiting behavior as smoothing parameters vanish. For each loss, we establish consistency with the corresponding social choice rule and characterize the axioms it satisfies or violates. Our analysis shows how design choices in loss geometry-such as margin sensitivity and boundary concentration-directly translate into normative aggregation behavior. Differential Voting makes preference aggregation an explicit and controllable design choice in RLHF, enabling principled trade-offs between axiomatic guarantees and optimization stability.

We benchmark eleven state-of-the-art LLMs under three regimes: (i) No Context, measuring reliance on parametric memory; (ii) Gold Context, where all oracle evidence is supplied at once; and (iii) Iterative RAG, a training-free controller that alternates retrieval, hypothesis refinement, and evidence-aware stopping. Using the chemistry-focused ChemKGMultiHopQA dataset, we isolate questions requiring genuine retrieval and analyze behavior with diagnostics spanning retrieval coverage gaps, anchor-carry drop, query quality, composition fidelity, and control calibration. Across models, Iterative RAG consistently outperforms Gold Context, with gains up to 25.6 percentage points, especially for non-reasoning fine-tuned models. Staged retrieval reduces late-hop failures, mitigates context overload, and enables dynamic correction of early hypothesis drift, but remaining failure modes include incomplete hop coverage, distractor latch trajectories, early stopping miscalibration, and high composition failure rates even with perfect retrieval. Overall, staged retrieval is often more influential than the mere presence of ideal evidence; we provide practical guidance for deploying and diagnosing RAG systems in specialized scientific settings and a foundation for more reliable, controllable iterative retrieval-reasoning frameworks."}

However, achieving accurate segmentation remains a significant challenge due to class imbalance, ambiguous boundaries, and noise interference in ultrasound images, compounded by the scarcity of high-quality annotated data. Current research on PSFH segmentation predominantly relies on CNN and Transformer architectures, leaving the potential of more powerful models underexplored. In this work, we propose a Dual-Student and Teacher framework combining CNN and SAM (DSTCS), which integrates the Segment Anything Model (SAM) into a dual student-teacher architecture. A cooperative learning mechanism between the CNN and SAM branches significantly improves segmentation accuracy. The proposed scheme also incorporates a specialized data augmentation strategy optimized for boundary processing and a novel loss function. Extensive experiments on the MICCAI 2023 and 2024 PSFH segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our method exhibits superior robustness and significantly outperforms existing techniques, providing a reliable segmentation tool for clinical practice."}

We introduce BabyReasoningBench, a GPT-5.2 generated benchmark of 19 reasoning tasks grounded in classic paradigms from developmental psychology, spanning theory of mind, analogical and relational reasoning, causal inference and intervention selection, and core reasoning primitives that are known to be confounded by memory and pragmatics. We find that two GPT-2 based baby language models (pretrained on 10M and 100M of child-directed speech text) show overall low but uneven performance, with dissociations across task families: scaling improves several causal and physical reasoning tasks, while belief attribution and pragmatics-sensitive tasks remain challenging. BabyReasoningBench provides a developmentally grounded lens for analyzing what kinds of reasoning are supported by child-like training distributions, and for testing mechanistic hypotheses about how such abilities emerge."}

AdaRAS identifies Reasoning-Critical Neurons (RCNs) via a polarity-aware mean-difference criterion and adaptively steers their activations during inference, enhancing incorrect reasoning traces while avoiding degradation on already-correct cases. Experiments on 10 mathematics and coding benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements, including over 13% gains on AIME-24 and AIME-25.

Turing's foundational result established the Halting Problem as undecidable, showing that no algorithm can universally determine termination for all programs and inputs. Consequently, automatic verification tools approximate termination, sometimes failing to prove or disprove; these tools rely on problem-specific architectures and abstractions, and are usually tied to particular programming languages. Recent success and progress in large language models (LLMs) raises the following question: can LLMs reliably predict program termination? In this work, we evaluate LLMs on a diverse set of C programs from the Termination category of the International Competition on Software Verification (SV-Comp) 2025. Our results suggest that LLMs perform remarkably well at predicting program termination, where GPT-5 and Claude Sonnet-4.5 would rank just behind the top-ranked tool (using test-time-scaling), and Code World Model (CWM) would place just behind the second-ranked tool. While LLMs are effective at predicting program termination, they often fail to provide a valid witness as a proof. Moreover, LLMs performance drops as program length increases. We hope these insights motivate further research into program termination and the broader potential of LLMs for reasoning about undecidable problems."}

Recent advances in large language models suggest that self-reflection, prompting a model to critique and revise its own outputs, can improve reasoning quality and factual consistency. Building on this idea, this paper introduces Reflective Translation, a prompt-based framework in which a model generates an initial translation, produces a structured self-critique, and then uses this reflection to generate a refined translation. The approach is evaluated on English-isiZulu and English-isiXhosa translation using OPUS-100 and NTREX-African, across multiple prompting strategies and confidence thresholds. Results show consistent improvements in both BLEU and COMET scores between first- and second-pass translations, with average gains of up to +0.22 BLEU and +0.18 COMET. Statistical significance testing using paired nonparametric tests confirms that these improvements are robust. The proposed method is model-agnostic, requires no fine-tuning, and introduces a reflection-augmented dataset that can support future supervised or analysis-driven work. These findings demonstrate that structured self-reflection is a practical and effective mechanism for improving translation quality in low-resource settings."}

However, existing human-scene interaction generation methods typically treat the scene as static, which deviates from reality. Inspired by world models, we introduce Dyn-HSI, the first cognitive architecture for dynamic human-scene interaction, which endows virtual humans with three humanoid components. (1)Vision (human eyes): we equip the virtual human with a Dynamic Scene-Aware Navigation, which continuously perceives changes in the surrounding environment and adaptively predicts the next waypoint. (2)Memory (human brain): we equip the virtual human with a Hierarchical Experience Memory, which stores and updates experiential data accumulated during training. This allows the model to leverage prior knowledge during inference for context-aware motion priming, thereby enhancing both motion quality and generalization. (3) Control (human body): we equip the virtual human with Human-Scene Interaction Diffusion Model, which generates high-fidelity interaction motions conditioned on multimodal inputs. To evaluate performance in dynamic scenes, we extend the existing static human-scene interaction datasets to construct a dynamic benchmark, Dyn-Scenes. We conduct extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments to validate Dyn-HSI, showing that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches and generates high-quality human-scene interaction motions in both static and dynamic settings."}

However, large-angle redirection is inherently ill-posed: a monocular video captures only a narrow spatio-temporal view of a dynamic 3D scene, providing highly partial observations of the underlying 4D world. The key challenge is therefore to recover a complete and coherent representation from this limited input, with consistent geometry and motion. While recent diffusion-based methods achieve impressive results, they often break down under large-angle viewpoint changes far from the original trajectory, where missing visual grounding leads to severe geometric ambiguity and temporal inconsistency. To address this, we present FreeOrbit4D, an effective training-free framework that tackles this geometric ambiguity by recovering a geometry-complete 4D proxy as structural grounding for video generation. We obtain this proxy by decoupling foreground and background reconstructions: we unproject the monocular video into a static background and geometry-incomplete foreground point clouds in a unified global space, then leverage an object-centric multi-view diffusion model to synthesize multi-view images and reconstruct geometry-complete foreground point clouds in canonical object space. By aligning the canonical foreground point cloud to the global scene space via dense pixel-synchronized 3D--3D correspondences and projecting the geometry-complete 4D proxy onto target camera viewpoints, we provide geometric scaffolds that guide a conditional video diffusion model. Extensive experiments show that FreeOrbit4D produces more faithful redirected videos under challenging large-angle trajectories, and our geometry-complete 4D proxy further opens a potential avenue for practical applications such as edit propagation and 4D data generation.

The system combines a multi-layer data lake, hybrid relational and vector storage, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and a rule-driven adaptive form model to transform unstructured clinical documentation into structured and standardised tumour board records. We assess the performance of six LLMs deployed through AWS Bedrock on ten lung cancer cases, measuring both completion form accuracy and end-to-end latency. The results demonstrate high performance across models, with the best performing configuration achieving an 80% of correct field completion and clinically acceptable response time for most LLMs. Larger and more recent models exhibit best accuracies without incurring prohibitive latency.

In LLMs, top-p/top-k sampling strategies work exceptionally well: language tokens have high semantic density and low redundancy, so a fixed size of token candidates already strikes a balance between semantic accuracy and generation diversity. In contrast, video tokens have low semantic density and high spatio-temporal redundancy. This mismatch makes static top-k/top-p strategies ineffective for video decoders: they either introduce unnecessary randomness for low-uncertainty regions (static backgrounds) or get stuck in early errors for high-uncertainty regions (foreground objects). Prediction errors will accumulate as more frames are generated and eventually severely degrade long-horizon quality. To address this, we propose Entropy-Guided k-Guard (ENkG) sampling, a simple yet effective strategy that adapts sampling to token-wise dispersion, quantified by the entropy of each token's predicted distribution. ENkG uses adaptive token candidate sizes: for low-entropy regions, it employs fewer candidates to suppress redundant noise and preserve structural integrity; for high-entropy regions, it uses more candidates to mitigate error compounding. ENkG is model-agnostic, training-free, and adds negligible overhead. Experiments demonstrate consistent improvements in perceptual quality and structural stability compared to static top-k/top-p strategies."}

Across models and languages, we observe consistent behavioral patterns, including incentive-sensitive conditional strategies and cross-linguistic divergence. To interpret these dynamics, we train supervised classifiers on canonical repeated-game strategies and apply them to LLM decisions, revealing systematic, model- and language-dependent behavioral intentions, with linguistic framing sometimes matching or exceeding architectural effects.

To robustly handle these heterogeneous settings, we develop a two-stage solution. In the first round, we use reverse per-Gaussian parallel optimization and compact forward splatting based on Taming-GS and Speedy-splat, load-balanced tiling, an anchor-based Neural-Gaussian representation enabling rapid convergence with fewer learnable parameters, initialization from monocular depth and partially from feed-forward 3DGS models, and a global pose refinement module for noisy SLAM trajectories. In the final round, the accurate COLMAP poses change the optimization landscape; we disable pose refinement, revert from Neural-Gaussians back to standard 3DGS to eliminate MLP inference overhead, introduce multi-view consistency-guided Gaussian splitting inspired by Fast-GS, and introduce a depth estimator to supervise the rendered depth. Together, these techniques enable high-fidelity reconstruction under a strict one-minute budget. Our method achieved the top performance with a PSNR of 28.43 and ranked first in the competition."}

Traditional search advertising, which relies on static keywords, fails to capture the fleeting, context-dependent user intents--the specific information, goods, or services a user seeks--embedded in conversational flows. Beyond the standard goal of social welfare maximization, effective LLM advertising imposes additional requirements on contextual coherence (ensuring ads align semantically with transient user intents) and computational efficiency (avoiding user interaction latency), as well as adherence to ethical and regulatory standards, including preserving privacy and ensuring explicit ad disclosure. Although various recent solutions have explored bidding on token-level and query-level, both categories of approaches generally fail to holistically satisfy this multifaceted set of constraints.\n  We propose a practical framework that resolves these tensions through two decoupling strategies. First, we decouple ad insertion from response generation to ensure safety and explicit disclosure. Second, we decouple bidding from specific user queries by using ``genres'' (high-level semantic clusters) as a proxy. This allows advertisers to bid on stable categories rather than sensitive real-time response, reducing computational burden and privacy risks. We demonstrate that applying the VCG auction mechanism to this genre-based framework yields approximately dominant strategy incentive compatibility (DSIC) and individual rationality (IR), as well as approximately optimal social welfare, while maintaining high computational efficiency. Finally, we introduce an \"LLM-as-a-Judge\" metric to estimate contextual coherence.

To this end, we introduce Cor2Vox, a cortex-grounded generative framework for brain magnetic resonance image (MRI) synthesis that ties image generation to continuous structural priors of the cerebral cortex. It leverages high-resolution cortical surfaces to guide a 3D shape-to-image Brownian bridge diffusion process, enabling topologically faithful synthesis and precise control over underlying anatomies. To support the generation of new, realistic brain shapes, we developed a large-scale statistical shape model of cortical morphology derived from over 33,000 UK Biobank scans. We validated the fidelity of Cor2Vox based on traditional image quality metrics, advanced cortical surface reconstruction, and whole-brain segmentation quality, outperforming many baseline methods. Across three applications, namely (i) anatomically consistent synthesis, (ii) simulation of progressive gray matter atrophy, and (iii) harmonization of in-house frontotemporal dementia scans with public datasets, Cor2Vox preserved fine-grained cortical morphology at the sub-voxel level, exhibiting remarkable robustness to variations in cortical geometry and disease phenotype without retraining."}

Current generative approaches, while capable of synthesizing realistic textures, often suffer from information asymmetry -- the intrinsic disparity between the information-sparse low quality inputs and the information-dense high quality outputs. This imbalance leads to a one-to-many mapping, where insufficient constraints result in stochastic uncertainty and hallucinatory artifacts. To bridge this gap, we present \\textbf{Pref-Restore}, a hierarchical framework that integrates discrete semantic logic with continuous texture generation to achieve deterministic, preference-aligned restoration. Our methodology fundamentally addresses this information disparity through two complementary strategies: (1) Augmenting Input Density: We employ an auto-regressive integrator to reformulate textual instructions into dense latent queries, injecting high-level semantic stability to constrain the degraded signals; (2) Pruning Output Distribution: We pioneer the integration of on-policy reinforcement learning directly into the diffusion restoration loop. By transforming human preferences into differentiable constraints, we explicitly penalize stochastic deviations, thereby sharpening the posterior distribution toward the desired high-fidelity outcomes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Pref-Restore achieves state-of-the-art performance across synthetic and real-world benchmarks. Furthermore, empirical analysis confirms that our preference-aligned strategy significantly reduces solution entropy, establishing a robust pathway toward reliable and deterministic blind restoration."}

Exposure correction still faces two critical challenges: (1) the ignorance of object-wise regional semantic information causes the color shift artifacts; (2) real-world exposure images generally have no ground-truth labels, and its labeling entails massive manual editing. To tackle the challenges, we propose a new unsupervised semantic-aware exposure correction network. It contains an adaptive semantic-aware fusion module, which effectively fuses the semantic information extracted from a pre-trained Fast Segment Anything Model into a shared image feature space. Then the fused features are used by our multi-scale residual spatial mamba group to restore the details and adjust the exposure. To avoid manual editing, we propose a pseudo-ground truth generator guided by CLIP, which is fine-tuned to automatically identify exposure situations and instruct the tailored corrections. Also, we leverage the rich priors from the FastSAM and CLIP to develop a semantic-prompt consistency loss to enforce semantic consistency and image-prompt alignment for unsupervised training. Comprehensive experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of our method in correcting real-world exposure images and outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods both numerically and visually."}

Mechanistically, SNR-Edit uses structure-aware noise rectification to inject segmentation constraints into the initial noise, anchoring the stochastic component of the source trajectory to the real image's implicit inversion position and reducing trajectory drift during source--target transport. This lightweight modification yields smoother latent trajectories and ensures high-fidelity structural preservation without requiring model tuning or inversion.

While 3D motion capture offers an objective alternative, its reliance on specialized hardware often precludes routine clinical use. In this paper, we propose a non-invasive computational framework that transforms monocular RGB video into clinically relevant 3D gait kinematics. Our pipeline uses Gravity-View Coordinates along with a novel trajectory-correction algorithm that leverages the closed-loop topology of our adapted Timed Up and Go (TUG) protocol to mitigate monocular depth errors. This novel pipeline enables the extraction of 297 explicit gait biomechanical biomarkers from a single camera capture.\n  To address the challenges of small clinical datasets, we introduce a stability-based machine learning framework that identifies robust motor signatures while preventing overfitting. Validated on the CALYPSO dataset, our method achieves an 83.3% accuracy in detecting PMR and explains 64% of the variance in overall depression severity (R^2=0.64).

UniPCB is built via a systematic pipeline that curates and standardizes data from disparate sources across three annotated scenarios.

To address these limitations, we present MaDiS, a masked-diffusion-based language model for SLG that captures bidirectional dependencies and supports efficient parallel multi-token generation. We further introduce a tri-level cross-modal pretraining scheme that jointly learns from token-, latent-, and 3D physical-space objectives, leading to richer and more grounded sign representations. To accelerate model convergence in the fine-tuning stage, we design a novel unmasking strategy with temporal checkpoints, reducing the combinatorial complexity of unmasking orders by over $10^{41}$ times. In addition, a mixture-of-parts embedding layer is developed to effectively fuse information stored in different part-wise sign tokens through learnable gates and well-optimized codebooks. Extensive experiments on CSL-Daily, Phoenix-2014T, and How2Sign demonstrate that MaDiS achieves superior performance across multiple metrics, including DTW error and two newly introduced metrics, SiBLEU and SiCLIP, while reducing inference latency by nearly 30%.

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates this issue by grounding answers in external sources, e.g., knowledge graphs (KGs). However, existing KG-based RAG approaches rely on semantics-unaware path sampling and are weakly aligned with KG reasoning objectives, which limits further accuracy gains. They also feed retrieved paths directly into the reasoner without organizing them into answer-centered reasoning paths, hindering small LLMs' ability to leverage the retrieved knowledge. Furthermore, prior works predominantly rely on large LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT/GPT-4) or assume backbones above 7B parameters, leaving sub-7B models underexplored. We address this gap with RPO-RAG, the first KG-based RAG framework specifically designed for small LLMs, to the best of our knowledge. RPO-RAG introduces three key innovations: (1) a query-path semantic sampling strategy that provides informative supervisory signals; (2) a relation-aware preference optimization that aligns training with intermediate KG reasoning signals (e.g., relation); and (3) an answer-centered prompt design that organizes entities and reasoning paths in an interpretable format. Extensive experiments on two benchmark Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) datasets, WebQSP and CWQ, demonstrate that RPO-RAG effectively bridges the performance gap between small and large language models. On WebQSP, it improves F1 by up to 8.8%, reflecting enhanced answer precision, while on CWQ it achieves new state-of-the-art results among models under 8B parameters in both Hit and F1. Overall, RPO-RAG substantially improves the reasoning capability of small LLMs, even under 3B parameters-highlighting their potential for resource-efficient and practical on-device KGQA applications."}

Traditional 3D pose estimation approaches often ignore the temporal consistency between frames, causing implausible and jittery motion. The emerging field of kinematics-based 3D motion capture addresses these issues by estimating the temporal transitioning between poses instead. A major drawback in current kinematics approaches is their reliance on Euler angles. Despite their simplicity, Euler angles suffer from discontinuity that leads to unstable motion reconstructions, especially in online settings where trajectory refinement is unavailable. Contrarily, quaternions have no discontinuity and can produce continuous transitions between poses. In this paper, we propose QuaMo, a novel Quaternion Motions method using quaternion differential equations (QDE) for human kinematics capture. We utilize the state-space model, an effective system for describing real-time kinematics estimations, with quaternion state and the QDE describing quaternion velocity. The corresponding angular acceleration is computed from a meta-PD controller with a novel acceleration enhancement that adaptively regulates the control signals as the human quickly changes to a new pose. Unlike previous work, our QDE is solved under the quaternion unit-sphere constraint that results in more accurate estimations. Experimental results show that our novel formulation of the QDE with acceleration enhancement accurately estimates 3D human kinematics with no discontinuity and minimal implausibilities. QuaMo outperforms comparable state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets, namely Human3.6M, Fit3D, SportsPose and AIST. The code is available at https://github.com/cuongle1206/QuaMo"}

The system includes a triples creator that builds structured facts about a concept, a semantic mapper that selects attributes useful for analogy, a stylized generator that turns them into riddle clues, and a validator that collects all possible answers the riddle could point to. We use this validator to study whether large language models can recover the full answer set for different riddle types.

However, monocular camera-based 3D detection suffers from depth ambiguity and reduced robustness under challenging conditions. Radar provides complementary advantages such as resilience to poor lighting and adverse weather, but its sparsity and low resolution limit its direct use in detection frameworks. This motivates the need for effective Radar-camera fusion with improved preprocessing and depth estimation strategies. We propose an end-to-end framework that enhances monocular 3D object detection through two key components. First, we introduce InstaRadar, an instance segmentation-guided expansion method that leverages pre-trained segmentation masks to enhance Radar density and semantic alignment, producing a more structured representation. InstaRadar achieves state-of-the-art results in Radar-guided depth estimation, showing its effectiveness in generating high-quality depth features. Second, we integrate the pre-trained RCDPT into the BEVDepth framework as a replacement for its depth module. With InstaRadar-enhanced inputs, the RCDPT integration consistently improves 3D detection performance. Overall, these components yield steady gains over the baseline BEVDepth model, demonstrating the effectiveness of InstaRadar and the advantage of explicit depth supervision in 3D object detection. Although the framework lags behind Radar-camera fusion models that directly extract BEV features, since Radar serves only as guidance rather than an independent feature stream, this limitation highlights potential for improvement. Future work will extend InstaRadar to point cloud-like representations and integrate a dedicated Radar branch with temporal cues for enhanced BEV fusion."}

Our key contribution is a Region-Specific Latent Axis Discovery method that learns localized muscle relaxation trajectories in StyleGAN2's latent space, enabling precise control over specific facial regions without global side effects. By correlating these localized latent trajectories with injected toxin units, we learn a predictive dose-response model. We rigorously compare two approaches: direct metric regression versus image-based generative simulation on a clinical dataset of N=360 images from 46 patients.

A key limitation is the insufficient modeling of the dense, multi-scale nature of both video and audio signals, correspondences often span fine- to coarse-grained spatial-temporal structures, which are underutilized in existing frameworks. To this end, we propose GMS-CAVP, a novel framework that combines Multi-Scale Video-Audio Alignment and Multi-Scale Spatial-Temporal Diffusion-based pretraining objectives to enhance V-A correspondence modeling.

To address this issue, prior work has explored two main lines of mitigation. One line attempts to identify and remove contaminated benchmark items before evaluation, but this inevitably alters the evaluation set itself and becomes unreliable when contamination is moderate or severe. The other line preserves the benchmark and instead suppresses contaminated behavior at evaluation time; however, such interventions often interfere with normal inference and lead to noticeable performance degradation on clean inputs. We propose DeconIEP, a decontamination framework that operates entirely during evaluation by applying small, bounded perturbations in the input embedding space. Guided by a relatively less-contaminated reference model, DeconIEP learns an instance-adaptive perturbation generator that steers the evaluated model away from memorization-driven shortcut pathways. Across multiple open-weight LLMs and benchmarks, extensive empirical results show that DeconIEP achieves strong decontamination effectiveness while incurring only minimal degradation in benign utility."}

Using state-of-the-art ConvNeXt models trained with DP-SGD across realistic privacy regimes, we compare non-domain-specific supervised ImageNet initialization, non-domain-specific self-supervised DINOv3 initialization, and domain-specific supervised pretraining on MIMIC-CXR, the largest publicly available chest radiograph dataset. Evaluations are conducted across five external datasets spanning diverse institutions and acquisition settings. We show that DINOv3 initialization consistently improves diagnostic utility relative to ImageNet initialization under DP, but remains inferior to domain-specific supervised pretraining, which achieves performance closest to non-private baselines. We further demonstrate that initialization choice strongly influences demographic fairness, cross-dataset generalization, and robustness to data scale and model capacity under privacy constraints.

However, existing object-centric perception paradigms and loosely coupled vision-language pipelines are still difficult to support management-oriented anomaly understanding required in real-world urban governance. To bridge this gap, we introduce GovLA-10K, the first management-oriented multi-modal benchmark for low-altitude intelligence, along with GovLA-Reasoner, a unified vision-language reasoning framework tailored for governance-aware aerial perception. Unlike existing studies that aim to exhaustively annotate all visible objects, GovLA-10K is deliberately designed around functionally salient targets that directly correspond to practical management needs, and further provides actionable management suggestions grounded in these observations. To effectively coordinate the fine-grained visual grounding with high-level contextual language reasoning, GovLA-Reasoner introduces an efficient feature adapter that implicitly coordinates discriminative representation sharing between the visual detector and the large language model (LLM). Extensive experiments show that our method significantly improves performance while avoiding the need of fine-tuning for any task-specific individual components. We believe our work offers a new perspective and foundation for future studies on management-aware low-altitude vision-language systems."}

Traditional search advertising, which relies on static keywords, fails to capture the fleeting, context-dependent user intents--the specific information, goods, or services a user seeks--embedded in conversational flows. Beyond the standard goal of social welfare maximization, effective LLM advertising imposes additional requirements on contextual coherence (ensuring ads align semantically with transient user intents) and computational efficiency (avoiding user interaction latency), as well as adherence to ethical and regulatory standards, including preserving privacy and ensuring explicit ad disclosure. Although various recent solutions have explored bidding on token-level and query-level, both categories of approaches generally fail to holistically satisfy this multifaceted set of constraints.\n  We propose a practical framework that resolves these tensions through two decoupling strategies. First, we decouple ad insertion from response generation to ensure safety and explicit disclosure. Second, we decouple bidding from specific user queries by using ``genres'' (high-level semantic clusters) as a proxy. This allows advertisers to bid on stable categories rather than sensitive real-time response, reducing computational burden and privacy risks. We demonstrate that applying the VCG auction mechanism to this genre-based framework yields approximately dominant strategy incentive compatibility (DSIC) and individual rationality (IR), as well as approximately optimal social welfare, while maintaining high computational efficiency. Finally, we introduce an \"LLM-as-a-Judge\" metric to estimate contextual coherence. Our experiments show that this metric correlates strongly with human ratings (Spearman's $ρ\\approx 0.66$), outperforming 80% of individual human evaluators."}

Motivated by this finding, KeepLoRA learns new tasks by restricting LoRA parameter updates in the residual subspace to prevent interfering with previously learned capabilities. Specifically, we infuse knowledge for a new task by projecting its gradient onto a subspace orthogonal to both the principal subspace of pre-trained model and the dominant directions of previous task features.

The second term evaluates the chromatic dissimilarity between two images in the Oklab perceptual color space. We evaluated the performance of our metric on a non-traditional dataset, called Berkeley-Adobe Perceptual Patch Similarity, which contains a wide range of complex distortions in shapes and colors. We have shown that our metric outperforms the state of the art, especially when images contain shape distortions, confirming also its greater perceptiveness. Furthermore, although deep black-box metrics could be very accurate, they only provide similarity scores between two images, without explaining their main differences and similarities. Our metric, on the other hand, provides visual explanations to support the calculated score, making the similarity assessment transparent and justified."}

To this end, we introduce Cor2Vox, a cortex-grounded generative framework for brain magnetic resonance image (MRI) synthesis that ties image generation to continuous structural priors of the cerebral cortex. It leverages high-resolution cortical surfaces to guide a 3D shape-to-image Brownian bridge diffusion process, enabling topologically faithful synthesis and precise control over underlying anatomies. To support the generation of new, realistic brain shapes, we developed a large-scale statistical shape model of cortical morphology derived from over 33,000 UK Biobank scans. We validated the fidelity of Cor2Vox based on traditional image quality metrics, advanced cortical surface reconstruction, and whole-brain segmentation quality, outperforming many baseline methods. Across three applications, namely (i) anatomically consistent synthesis, (ii) simulation of progressive gray matter atrophy, and (iii) harmonization of in-house frontotemporal dementia scans with public datasets, Cor2Vox preserved fine-grained cortical morphology at the sub-voxel level, exhibiting remarkable robustness to variations in cortical geometry and disease phenotype without retraining."}

As a result, they struggle to represent functions that are continuous yet deliberately non-differentiable (i.e., with prescribed $C^0$ sharp features) without relying on ad hoc post-processing. We present SharpNet, a modified MLP architecture capable of encoding functions with user-defined sharp features by enriching the network with an auxiliary feature function, which is defined as the solution to a Poisson equation with jump Neumann boundary conditions. It is evaluated via an efficient local integral that is fully differentiable with respect to the feature locations, enabling our method to jointly optimize both the feature locations and the MLP parameters to recover the target functions/models. The $C^0$-continuity of SharpNet is precisely controllable, ensuring $C^0$-continuity at the feature locations and smoothness elsewhere. We validate SharpNet on 2D problems and 3D CAD model reconstruction, and compare it against several state-of-the-art baselines. In both types of tasks, SharpNet accurately recovers sharp edges and corners while maintaining smooth behavior away from those features, whereas existing methods tend to smooth out gradient discontinuities.

Structured pruning methods are primarily employed to improve the inference efficiency of pre-trained models.

To simultaneously enhance the training and inference efficiency of downstream task fine-tuning, we introduce GradPruner, which can prune layers of LLMs guided by gradients in the early stages of fine-tuning. GradPruner uses the cumulative gradients of each parameter during the initial phase of fine-tuning to compute the Initial Gradient Information Accumulation Matrix (IGIA-Matrix) to assess the importance of layers and perform pruning. We sparsify the pruned layers based on the IGIA-Matrix and merge them with the remaining layers. Only elements with the same sign are merged to reduce interference from sign variations. We conducted extensive experiments on two LLMs across eight downstream datasets. Including medical, financial, and general benchmark tasks. The results demonstrate that GradPruner has achieved a parameter reduction of 40% with only a 0.99% decrease in accuracy. Our code is publicly available."}

A key limitation is the insufficient modeling of the dense, multi-scale nature of both video and audio signals, correspondences often span fine- to coarse-grained spatial-temporal structures, which are underutilized in existing frameworks. To this end, we propose GMS-CAVP, a novel framework that combines Multi-Scale Video-Audio Alignment and Multi-Scale Spatial-Temporal Diffusion-based pretraining objectives to enhance V-A correspondence modeling. First, GMS-CAVP introduces a multi-scale contrastive learning strategy that captures semantic and temporal relations across varying granularities.

Instead of pre-training a fixed-size model, we learn a shared weight template and size-specific weight scalers under Tucker-based factorization, which promotes modularity and supports flexible adaptation to architectures with varying depths and widths. Target models are subsequently initialized by composing and reweighting the template through lightweight weight scalers, whose parameters can be efficiently learned from minimal training data.

However, their unpredictable positions across diffusion steps undermine inference robustness. To resolve this, we propose a simple but effective extra sink token implemented via a modified attention mask. Specifically, we introduce a special token constrained to attend solely to itself, while remaining globally visible to all other tokens.

We further introduce voxel-aligned 3D feature aggregation and dual self-supervision to maintain scene coherence and fine details while substantially reducing dependence on labeled data. GeoDiff3D also trains with low computational cost and enables fast, high-quality 3D scene generation. Extensive experiments on challenging scenes show improved generalization and generation quality over existing baselines, offering a practical solution for accessible and efficient 3D scene construction."}

We ask whether LLMs can be systematically manipulated to reproduce language-production impairments characteristic of aphasia following focal brain lesions. Such models could provide scalable proxies for testing rehabilitation hypotheses, and offer a controlled framework for probing the functional organization of language. We introduce a clinically grounded, component-level framework that simulates aphasia by selectively perturbing functional components in LLMs, and apply it to both modular Mixture-of-Experts models and dense Transformers using a unified intervention interface. Our pipeline (i) identifies subtype-linked components for Broca's and Wernicke's aphasia, (ii) interprets these components with linguistic probing tasks, and (iii) induces graded impairments by progressively perturbing the top-k subtype-linked components, evaluating outcomes with Western Aphasia Battery (WAB) subtests summarized by Aphasia Quotient (AQ). Across architectures and lesioning strategies, subtype-targeted perturbations yield more systematic, aphasia-like regressions than size-matched random perturbations, and MoE modularity supports more localized and interpretable phenotype-to-component mappings. These findings suggest that modular LLMs, combined with clinically informed component perturbations, provide a promising platform for simulating aphasic language production and studying how distinct language functions degrade under targeted disruptions."}

In this study, we assess the effectiveness of a diffusion-based ear inpainting technique as a pre-processing aid to mitigate the issues of ear accessory occlusions in transformer-based ear recognition systems. Given an input ear image and an automatically derived accessory mask, the inpainting model reconstructs clean and anatomically plausible ear regions by synthesizing missing pixels while preserving local geometric coherence along key ear structures, including the helix, antihelix, concha, and lobule. We evaluate the effectiveness of this pre-processing aid in transformer-based recognition systems for several vision transformer models and different patch sizes for a range of benchmark datasets. Experiments show that diffusion-based inpainting can be a useful pre-processing aid to alleviate ear accessory occlusions to improve overall recognition performance."}

Although prior arts offer various activation optimization strategies, their data-agnostic nature ultimately results in ineffective and unstable fine tuning. In this paper, we propose TokenSeek, a universal plugin solution for various transformer-based models through instance-aware token seeking and ditching, achieving significant fine-tuning memory savings (e.g., requiring only 14.8% of the memory on Llama3.2 1B) with on-par or even better performance. Furthermore, our interpretable token seeking process reveals the underlying reasons for its effectiveness, offering valuable insights for future research on token efficiency.

We attribute this deficiency to a suboptimal training paradigm inherent in prevailing VLMs, which exhibits a text-dominant optimization bias by conceptualizing visual signals merely as passive conditional inputs rather than supervisory targets. To mitigate this, we introduce Youtu-VL, a framework leveraging the Vision-Language Unified Autoregressive Supervision (VLUAS) paradigm, which fundamentally shifts the optimization objective from ``vision-as-input'' to ``vision-as-target.'' By integrating visual tokens directly into the prediction stream, Youtu-VL applies unified autoregressive supervision to both visual details and linguistic content. Furthermore, we extend this paradigm to encompass vision-centric tasks, enabling a standard VLM to perform vision-centric tasks without task-specific additions. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that Youtu-VL achieves competitive performance on both general multimodal tasks and vision-centric tasks, establishing a robust foundation for the development of comprehensive generalist visual agents."}

Inspired by recent advances in Video QA, many existing AVQA approaches primarily focus on visual information processing, leveraging pre-trained models to extract object-level and motion-level representations. However, in those methods, the audio input is primarily treated as complementary to video analysis, and the textual question information contributes minimally to audio--visual understanding, as it is typically integrated only in the final stages of reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Query-guided Spatial--Temporal--Frequency (QSTar) interaction method, which effectively incorporates question-guided clues and exploits the distinctive frequency-domain characteristics of audio signals, alongside spatial and temporal perception, to enhance audio--visual understanding. Furthermore, we introduce a Query Context Reasoning (QCR) block inspired by prompting, which guides the model to focus more precisely on semantically relevant audio and visual features. Extensive experiments conducted on several AVQA benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving significant performance improvements over existing Audio QA, Visual QA, Video QA, and AVQA approaches. The code and pretrained models will be released after publication."}

We provide the first controlled, mechanism-level diagnostic study of whether synchronized iterative retrieval and reasoning can surpass an idealized static upper bound (Gold Context) RAG. We benchmark eleven state-of-the-art LLMs under three regimes: (i) No Context, measuring reliance on parametric memory; (ii) Gold Context, where all oracle evidence is supplied at once; and (iii) Iterative RAG, a training-free controller that alternates retrieval, hypothesis refinement, and evidence-aware stopping. Using the chemistry-focused ChemKGMultiHopQA dataset, we isolate questions requiring genuine retrieval and analyze behavior with diagnostics spanning retrieval coverage gaps, anchor-carry drop, query quality, composition fidelity, and control calibration. Across models, Iterative RAG consistently outperforms Gold Context, with gains up to 25.6 percentage points, especially for non-reasoning fine-tuned models. Staged retrieval reduces late-hop failures, mitigates context overload, and enables dynamic correction of early hypothesis drift, but remaining failure modes include incomplete hop coverage, distractor latch trajectories, early stopping miscalibration, and high composition failure rates even with perfect retrieval. Overall, staged retrieval is often more influential than the mere presence of ideal evidence; we provide practical guidance for deploying and diagnosing RAG systems in specialized scientific settings and a foundation for more reliable, controllable iterative retrieval-reasoning frameworks."}

Hyperbolic geometry provides a natural framework for representing such structures. Building on this property, this work introduces HexFormer, a hyperbolic vision transformer for image classification that incorporates exponential map aggregation within its attention mechanism. Two designs are explored: a hyperbolic ViT (HexFormer) and a hybrid variant (HexFormer-Hybrid) that combines a hyperbolic encoder with an Euclidean linear classification head. HexFormer incorporates a novel attention mechanism based on exponential map aggregation, which yields more accurate and stable aggregated representations than standard centroid based averaging, showing that simpler approaches retain competitive merit. Experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate consistent performance improvements over Euclidean baselines and prior hyperbolic ViTs, with the hybrid variant achieving the strongest overall results. Additionally, this study provides an analysis of gradient stability in hyperbolic transformers. The results reveal that hyperbolic models exhibit more stable gradients and reduced sensitivity to warmup strategies compared to Euclidean architectures, highlighting their robustness and efficiency in training. Overall, these findings indicate that hyperbolic geometry can enhance vision transformer architectures by improving gradient stability and accuracy. In addition, relatively simple mechanisms such as exponential map aggregation can provide strong practical benefits."}

Vision Transformers (ViTs), in turn, provide global connectivity but lack spatial inductive bias, depend on explicit positional encodings, and remain tied to the initial patch size. Bridging these limitations requires a representation that is both structured and global. We introduce SONIC (Spectral Oriented Neural Invariant Convolutions), a continuous spectral parameterisation that models convolutional operators using a small set of shared, orientation-selective components. These components define smooth responses across the full frequency domain, yielding global receptive fields and filters that adapt naturally across resolutions. Across synthetic benchmarks, large-scale image classification, and 3D medical datasets, SONIC shows improved robustness to geometric transformations, noise, and resolution shifts, and matches or exceeds convolutional, attention-based, and prior spectral architectures with an order of magnitude fewer parameters. These results demonstrate that continuous, orientation-aware spectral parameterisations provide a principled and scalable alternative to conventional spatial and spectral operators."}

Consequently, these methods are prone to factual hallucinations and generalization bottlenecks in open-world settings or scenarios requiring dynamic knowledge. To address these challenges, we propose a Hierarchical Localization Agent, called LocationAgent. Our core philosophy is to retain hierarchical reasoning logic within the model while offloading the verification of geographic evidence to external tools. To implement hierarchical reasoning, we design the RER architecture (Reasoner-Executor-Recorder), which employs role separation and context compression to prevent the drifting problem in multi-step reasoning. For evidence verification, we construct a suite of clue exploration tools that provide diverse evidence to support location reasoning. Furthermore, to address data leakage and the scarcity of Chinese data in existing datasets, we introduce CCL-Bench (China City Location Bench), an image geolocation benchmark encompassing various scene granularities and difficulty levels.

Each agent corresponds to a state in the hyper automaton, and runs a small rule-based sub-automaton for reliable micro-control. All agents read and write a shared memory, yielding transparent execution history. To supervise the hyper agent's transition policy, we build transition-trajectory trees and transform to memory-to-next-state pairs, forming the MATA-SFT-90K dataset for supervised finetuning (SFT). The finetuned LLM as the transition policy understands the query and the capacity of agents, and it can efficiently choose the optimal agent to solve the task. Across multiple visual reasoning benchmarks, MATA achieves the state-of-the-art results compared with monolithic and compositional baselines.
