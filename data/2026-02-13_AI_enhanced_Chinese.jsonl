Code: https://github.com/amap-cvlab/ABot-Manipulation . 22 pages, 10 figures, 10 tables", "summary": "Building general-purpose embodied agents across diverse hardware remains a central challenge in robotics, often framed as the ''one-brain, many-forms'' paradigm. Progress is hindered by fragmented data, inconsistent representations, and misaligned training objectives. We present ABot-M0, a framework that builds a systematic data curation pipeline while jointly optimizing model architecture and training strategies, enabling end-to-end transformation of heterogeneous raw data into unified, efficient representations. From six public datasets, we clean, standardize, and balance samples to construct UniACT-dataset, a large-scale dataset with over 6 million trajectories and 9,500 hours of data, covering diverse robot morphologies and task scenarios. Unified pre-training improves knowledge transfer and generalization across platforms and tasks, supporting general-purpose embodied intelligence. To improve action prediction efficiency and stability, we propose the Action Manifold Hypothesis: effective robot actions lie not in the full high-dimensional space but on a low-dimensional, smooth manifold governed by physical laws and task constraints. Based on this, we introduce Action Manifold Learning (AML), which uses a DiT backbone to predict clean, continuous action sequences directly. This shifts learning from denoising to projection onto feasible manifolds, improving decoding speed and policy stability. ABot-M0 supports modular perception via a dual-stream mechanism that integrates VLM semantics with geometric priors and multi-view inputs from plug-and-play 3D modules such as VGGT and Qwen-Image-Edit, enhancing spatial understanding without modifying the backbone and mitigating standard VLM limitations in 3D reasoning. Experiments show components operate independently with additive benefits. We will release all code and pipelines for reproducibility and future research.", "AI": {"tldr": "ABot-M0\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u667a\u80fd\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6570\u636e\u6574\u7406\u3001\u7edf\u4e00\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u6d41\u5f62\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5f02\u6784\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u7684\"\u4e00\u4e2a\u5927\u8111\uff0c\u591a\u79cd\u5f62\u6001\"\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u901a\u7528\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u667a\u80fd\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u786c\u4ef6\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u6570\u636e\u788e\u7247\u5316\u3001\u8868\u793a\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u5e73\u53f0\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "method": "1) \u6784\u5efa\u7cfb\u7edf\u6570\u636e\u6574\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ece6\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u521b\u5efaUniACT-dataset\uff1b2) \u63d0\u51fa\u52a8\u4f5c\u6d41\u5f62\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528DiT\u4e3b\u5e72\u8fdb\u884c\u52a8\u4f5c\u6d41\u5f62\u5b66\u4e60\uff1b3) \u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u6d41\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u96c6\u6210VLM\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u5148\u9a8c\uff1b4) \u652f\u6301\u63d2\u4ef6\u5f0f3D\u6a21\u5757\u589e\u5f3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b600\u4e07\u8f68\u8ff9\u30019500\u5c0f\u65f6\u6570\u636e\u7684UniACT-dataset\uff1b\u7edf\u4e00\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u5e73\u53f0\u4efb\u52a1\u6cdb\u5316\uff1b\u52a8\u4f5c\u6d41\u5f62\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u9ad8\u52a8\u4f5c\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff1b\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u7ec4\u4ef6\u72ec\u7acb\u8fd0\u884c\u4e14\u6709\u7d2f\u52a0\u6548\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "ABot-M0\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6570\u636e\u6574\u7406\u3001\u7edf\u4e00\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u6d41\u5f62\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u901a\u7528\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u667a\u80fd\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5404\u7ec4\u4ef6\u72ec\u7acb\u8fd0\u884c\u4e14\u6548\u76ca\u53ef\u7d2f\u52a0\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

A representative leaf group is selected and converted into a thin, sharp mesh to serve as a template; this template is then fitted to all other leaves via differentiable Moving Least Squares (MLS) deformation.

The proposed pipeline contains data preprocessing, data splitting, adversarial training, augmentation, model training, evaluation, and comprehension made possible with Explainable AI strategies. DenseNet201 and EfficientNetB3 were employed to perform the classification task. To prepare the model more robustly, we applied adversarial training so it can operate effectively even with noisy or disturbed inputs. In addition, Grad-CAM visualization was executed to analyze the model's predictions by identifying the most influential regions of each image.

These approaches operate by first applying edits in the rendered 2D space and subsequently projecting the modifications back into 3D. However, this paradigm inevitably introduces cross-view inconsistencies and constrains both the flexibility and efficiency of the editing process. To address these challenges, we present VF-Editor, which enables native editing of Gaussian primitives by predicting attribute variations in a feedforward manner. To accurately and efficiently estimate these variations, we design a novel variation predictor distilled from 2D editing knowledge.

However, existing self-play methods for vision-language models rely on passive interaction with static image collections, resulting in strong dependence on initial datasets and inefficient learning. Without the ability to actively seek visual data tailored to their evolving capabilities, agents waste computational effort on samples that are either trivial or beyond their current skill level. To address these limitations, we propose Active-Zero, a framework that shifts from passive interaction to active exploration of visual environments. Active-Zero employs three co-evolving agents: a Searcher that retrieves images from open-world repositories based on the model's capability frontier, a Questioner that synthesizes calibrated reasoning tasks, and a Solver refined through accuracy rewards. This closed loop enables self-scaffolding auto-curricula where the model autonomously constructs its learning trajectory. On Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct across 12 benchmarks, Active-Zero achieves 53.97 average accuracy on reasoning tasks (5.7% improvement) and 59.77 on general understanding (3.9% improvement), consistently outperforming existing self-play baselines.

We identified three desirable attributes of avatar generation: 1) the method should be feed-forward, 2) model a 360\u00b0 full-head, and 3) should be animation-ready. However, current work addresses only two of the three points simultaneously. To address these limitations, we propose OMEGA-Avatar, the first feed-forward framework that simultaneously generates a generalizable, 360\u00b0-complete, and animatable 3D Gaussian head from a single image. Starting from a feed-forward and animatable framework, we address the 360\u00b0 full-head avatar generation problem with two novel components. First, to overcome poor hair modeling in full-head avatar generation, we introduce a semantic-aware mesh deformation module that integrates multi-view normals to optimize a FLAME head with hair while preserving its topology structure. Second, to enable effective feed-forward decoding of full-head features, we propose a multi-view feature splatting module that constructs a shared canonical UV representation from features across multiple views through differentiable bilinear splatting, hierarchical UV mapping, and visibility-aware fusion. This approach preserves both global structural coherence and local high-frequency details across all viewpoints, ensuring 360\u00b0 consistency without per-instance optimization.

The framework is grounded in the concept of hyperelasticity with energy limiters and employs Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to separately learn the intact (undamaged) elastic response and damage evolution directly from data. In Stage I, GPR models learn the intact hyperelastic response through volumetric and isochoric response functions (or only the isochoric response under incompressibility), ensuring energetic consistency of the intact response and satisfaction of fundamental principles such as material frame indifference and balance of angular momentum. In Stage II, damage is modeled via a separate GPR model that learns the mapping between the intact strain energy density predicted by Stage I models and a stress-reduction factor governing damage and failure, with monotonicity, non-negativity, and complete-failure constraints enforced through penalty-based optimization to ensure thermodynamic admissibility. Validation on synthetic datasets, including benchmarking against analytical constitutive models and competing data-driven approaches, demonstrates high in-distribution accuracy under uniaxial tension and robust generalization from limited training data to compression and shear modes not used during training. Application to experimental brain tissue data demonstrates the practical applicability of the framework and enables inference of damage evolution and critical failure energy. Overall, the proposed framework combines the physical consistency, interpretability, and generalizability of analytical models with the flexibility, predictive accuracy, and automation of machine learning, offering a powerful approach for modeling failure in soft materials under limited experimental data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u672c\u6784\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u8d85\u5f39\u6027\u8f6f\u6750\u6599\u7684\u6e10\u8fdb\u635f\u4f24\u548c\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u56de\u5f52\u5b66\u4e60\u5b8c\u6574\u5f39\u6027\u54cd\u5e94\u548c\u635f\u4f24\u6f14\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63cf\u8ff0\u8f6f\u6750\u6599\u590d\u6742\u635f\u4f24\u884c\u4e3a\u65f6\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u800c\u7eaf\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u7269\u7406\u539f\u7406\u53c8\u5177\u5907\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u7528GPR\u5b66\u4e60\u5b8c\u6574\u8d85\u5f39\u6027\u54cd\u5e94\uff08\u4f53\u79ef\u548c\u7b49\u5bb9\u54cd\u5e94\u51fd\u6570\uff09\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u80fd\u91cf\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u7269\u7406\u539f\u7406\u6ee1\u8db3\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u7528\u72ec\u7acbGPR\u5b66\u4e60\u4ece\u5b8c\u6574\u5e94\u53d8\u80fd\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5230\u5e94\u529b\u6298\u51cf\u56e0\u5b50\u7684\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u60e9\u7f5a\u4f18\u5316\u5f3a\u5236\u5355\u8c03\u6027\u3001\u975e\u8d1f\u6027\u548c\u5b8c\u5168\u5931\u6548\u7ea6\u675f\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u5bb9\u8bb8\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u663e\u793a\u9ad8\u5185\u5206\u5e03\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff08\u5355\u8f74\u62c9\u4f38\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u4ece\u6709\u9650\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u672a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u548c\u526a\u5207\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8111\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6570\u636e\u6210\u529f\u63a8\u65ad\u635f\u4f24\u6f14\u5316\u548c\u4e34\u754c\u5931\u6548\u80fd\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4e3a\u6709\u9650\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u8f6f\u6750\u6599\u5931\u6548\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u529b\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

The simplest mode of non-convergence is cyclical or periodic behavior. Such cycles are fundamental objects, and have inspired a number of significant insights in the field, beginning with the pioneering work of Shapley (1964). However a central question remains unanswered: which cycles are stable under game dynamics? In this paper we give a complete and computational answer to this question for the two best-studied dynamics, fictitious play/best-response dynamics and the replicator dynamic. We show (1) that a periodic sequence of profiles is stable under one of these dynamics if and only it is stable under the other, and (2) we provide a polynomial-time spectral stability test to determine whether a given periodic sequence is stable under either dynamic. Finally, we give an entirely `structural' sufficient condition for stability: every cycle that is a sink equilibrium of the preference graph of the game is stable, and moreover it is an attractor of the replicator dynamic. This result generalizes the famous theorems of Shapley (1964) and Jordan (1993), and extends the frontier of recent work relating the preference graph to the replicator attractors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3a\u4e24\u4eba\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\u7684\u5468\u671f\u884c\u4e3a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6027\u7b54\u6848\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u865a\u6784\u535a\u5f08/\u6700\u4f18\u54cd\u5e94\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u590d\u5236\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u8c31\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u504f\u597d\u56fe\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u5145\u5206\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bb8\u591a\u7ecf\u5178\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\uff08\u5982\u865a\u6784\u535a\u5f08\u548c\u590d\u5236\u52a8\u6001\uff09\u5728\u4e00\u822cN\u4eba\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\u4e0d\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u6700\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u975e\u6536\u655b\u6a21\u5f0f\u662f\u5468\u671f\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5468\u671f\u662f\u57fa\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u4f46\u4e00\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u95ee\u9898\u4ecd\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\uff1a\u54ea\u4e9b\u5468\u671f\u5728\u535a\u5f08\u52a8\u6001\u4e0b\u662f\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\uff1f\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u4e3a\u4e24\u79cd\u6700\u7ecf\u5178\u52a8\u6001\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6027\u7b54\u6848\u3002", "method": "1) \u8bc1\u660e\u865a\u6784\u535a\u5f08/\u6700\u4f18\u54cd\u5e94\u52a8\u6001\u4e0e\u590d\u5236\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u5468\u671f\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\uff1b2) \u5f00\u53d1\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u8c31\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5224\u65ad\u7ed9\u5b9a\u5468\u671f\u5e8f\u5217\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u4e0b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff1b3) \u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u504f\u597d\u56fe\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u5145\u5206\u6761\u4ef6\uff1a\u82e5\u5468\u671f\u662f\u535a\u5f08\u504f\u597d\u56fe\u7684\u6c47\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5219\u5b83\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u662f\u590d\u5236\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u5438\u5f15\u5b50\u3002", "result": "1) \u4e24\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u5468\u671f\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5b8c\u5168\u7b49\u4ef7\uff1b2) \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u8c31\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff1b3) \u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u504f\u597d\u56fe\u6c47\u5e73\u8861\u5468\u671f\u5fc5\u7136\u662f\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\uff0c\u4e14\u662f\u590d\u5236\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u5438\u5f15\u5b50\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u7ed3\u679c\u63a8\u5e7f\u4e86Shapley(1964)\u548cJordan(1993)\u7684\u8457\u540d\u5b9a\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u4e3a\u4e24\u4eba\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\u7684\u5468\u671f\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6027\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u7ecf\u5178\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7b49\u4ef7\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u504f\u597d\u56fe\u7406\u8bba\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6df1\u5316\u4e86\u5bf9\u535a\u5f08\u52a8\u6001\u6536\u655b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

We propose two GenAI based approaches, generative conditional diffusion model (GCDM) and generative conditional diffusion implicit model (GCDIM), leveraging the diffusion model conditioned on dynamic CSI to maximize the sum spectral efficiency (SE) of the system. To benchmark performance, we compare the proposed GenAI based approaches against an expert algorithm, traditionally known for achieving near-optimal solutions at the cost of computational efficiency.

Our focus is on investigating first-order gradient-based algorithms and their variations, such as the block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm, for tackling this problem. We introduce a set of conditions, called the $n$-sided PL condition, which extends the well-established gradient dominance condition a.k.a Polyak-\u0141ojasiewicz (PL) condition and the concept of multi-convexity. This condition, satisfied by various classes of non-convex functions, allows us to analyze the convergence of various gradient descent (GD) algorithms. Moreover, our study delves into scenarios where the standard gradient descent methods fail to converge to NE. In such cases, we propose adapted variants of GD that converge towards NE and analyze their convergence rates.

However, existing RAG studies typically assume well-structured textual sources (e.g. Wikipedia or curated datasets) and perform retrieval and generation at query time, which can limit their applicability in real-world chatbot scenarios. In this paper, we present HybridRAG, a novel and practical RAG framework towards more accurate and faster chatbot responses. First, HybridRAG ingests raw, unstructured PDF documents containing complex layouts (text, tables, figures) via Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and layout analysis, and convert them into hierarchical text chunks. Then, it pre-generates a plausible question-answer (QA) knowledge base from the organized chunks using an LLM. At query time, user questions are matched against this QA bank to retrieve immediate answers when possible, and only if no suitable QA match is found does our framework fall back to an on-the-fly response generation. Experiments on OHRBench demonstrate that our HybridRAG provides higher answer quality and lower latency compared to a standard RAG baseline. We believe that HybridRAG could be a practical solution for real-world chatbot applications that must handle large volumes of unstructured documents and lots of users under limited computational resources.", "AI": {"tldr": "HybridRAG\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684RAG\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u751f\u6210QA\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u6587\u672c\u5757\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u54cd\u5e94\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u5927\u91cf\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6587\u6863\u7684\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709RAG\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5047\u8bbe\u7ed3\u6784\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6587\u672c\u6e90\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u67e5\u8be2\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u5904\u7406\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6587\u6863\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u66f4\u5feb\u901f\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u6765\u5904\u7406\u5305\u542b\u590d\u6742\u5e03\u5c40\u7684\u539f\u59cbPDF\u6587\u6863\u3002", "method": "1. \u901a\u8fc7OCR\u548c\u5e03\u5c40\u5206\u6790\u5904\u7406\u5305\u542b\u590d\u6742\u5e03\u5c40\uff08\u6587\u672c\u3001\u8868\u683c\u3001\u56fe\u5f62\uff09\u7684\u539f\u59cb\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316PDF\u6587\u6863\uff0c\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5206\u5c42\u6587\u672c\u5757\uff1b2. \u4f7f\u7528LLM\u4ece\u7ec4\u7ec7\u597d\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5757\u4e2d\u9884\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u4fe1\u7684\u95ee\u7b54\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\uff1b3. \u67e5\u8be2\u65f6\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u95ee\u9898\u9996\u5148\u4e0eQA\u5e93\u5339\u914d\u4ee5\u83b7\u53d6\u5373\u65f6\u7b54\u6848\uff0c\u4ec5\u5f53\u6ca1\u6709\u5408\u9002\u5339\u914d\u65f6\u624d\u56de\u9000\u5230\u5b9e\u65f6\u54cd\u5e94\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5728OHRBench\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cHybridRAG\u76f8\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6RAG\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u5927\u91cf\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6587\u6863\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u9650\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0b\u652f\u6301\u5927\u91cf\u7528\u6237\u3002", "conclusion": "HybridRAG\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5fc5\u987b\u5904\u7406\u5927\u91cf\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6587\u6863\u548c\u4f17\u591a\u7528\u6237\u7684\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u54cd\u5e94\u901f\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u90fd\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u3002"}}

Explainable AI (XAI) addresses this by clarifying how models generate predictions, yet most methods demand technical expertise, limiting their value for novices. This gap is especially critical in no-code ML platforms, which seek to democratize AI but rarely include explainability. We present a human-centered XAI module in DashAI, an open-source no-code ML platform. The module integrates three complementary techniques, which are Partial Dependence Plots (PDP), Permutation Feature Importance (PFI), and KernelSHAP, into DashAI's workflow for tabular classification. A user study (N = 20; ML novices and experts) evaluated usability and the impact of explanations. Results show: (i) high task success ($\\geq80\\%$) across all explainability tasks; (ii) novices rated explanations as useful, accurate, and trustworthy on the Explanation Satisfaction Scale (ESS, Cronbach's $\u03b1$ = 0.74, a measure of internal consistency), while experts were more critical of sufficiency and completeness; and (iii) explanations improved perceived predictability and confidence on the Trust in Automation scale (TiA, $\u03b1$ = 0.60), with novices showing higher trust than experts. These findings highlight a central challenge for XAI in no-code ML, making explanations both accessible to novices and sufficiently detailed for experts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728DashAI\u65e0\u4ee3\u7801ML\u5e73\u53f0\u4e2d\u96c6\u6210PDP\u3001PFI\u548cKernelSHAP\u4e09\u79cd\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5bf9\u65b0\u624b\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u7684\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u548c\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u654f\u611f\u9886\u57df\u5e94\u7528\u589e\u52a0\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u5bf9\u51b3\u7b56\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u7684\u62c5\u5fe7\u3002\u867d\u7136\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\uff08XAI\uff09\u80fd\u591f\u6f84\u6e05\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f46\u5927\u591a\u6570\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u6280\u672f\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u65b0\u624b\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u5dee\u8ddd\u5728\u65e0\u4ee3\u7801ML\u5e73\u53f0\u4e2d\u5c24\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5e73\u53f0\u65e8\u5728\u6c11\u4e3b\u5316AI\u4f46\u5f88\u5c11\u5305\u542b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u529f\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u5f00\u6e90\u65e0\u4ee3\u7801ML\u5e73\u53f0DashAI\u4e2d\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ee5\u4eba\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684XAI\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u4e92\u8865\u6280\u672f\uff1a\u90e8\u5206\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fe\uff08PDP\uff09\u3001\u6392\u5217\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff08PFI\uff09\u548cKernelSHAP\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8868\u683c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\uff08N=20\uff0c\u5305\u62ecML\u65b0\u624b\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\uff09\u8bc4\u4f30\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "1. \u6240\u6709\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u226580%\uff1b2. \u65b0\u624b\u5728\u89e3\u91ca\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\u91cf\u8868\uff08ESS\uff0c\u03b1=0.74\uff09\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4ef7\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u6709\u7528\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\uff0c\u800c\u4e13\u5bb6\u5bf9\u5145\u5206\u6027\u548c\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u66f4\u4e3a\u6279\u5224\uff1b3. \u89e3\u91ca\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4fe1\u4efb\u91cf\u8868\uff08TiA\uff0c\u03b1=0.60\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u548c\u4fe1\u5fc3\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u65b0\u624b\u6bd4\u4e13\u5bb6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u7a81\u663e\u4e86\u65e0\u4ee3\u7801ML\u4e2dXAI\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u9700\u8981\u4f7f\u89e3\u91ca\u65e2\u5bf9\u65b0\u624b\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\uff0c\u53c8\u5bf9\u4e13\u5bb6\u8db3\u591f\u8be6\u7ec6\u3002\u5728DashAI\u4e2d\u96c6\u6210\u591a\u79cdXAI\u6280\u672f\u80fd\u591f\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e0d\u540c\u7528\u6237\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u5e73\u8861\u7b80\u5355\u6027\u548c\u5168\u9762\u6027\u3002"}}

Drawing from science-fiction novels, the project extracts sentences that describe human-machine interaction. We use large language models (LLMs) to generate paired prompts \"what to do\" and \"what not to do\" for each excerpt. A diffusion-based text-to-video model transforms these prompts into choreographic guides for a human performer and motor commands for a quadruped robot. Both agents enact the actions on a mirrored floor, captured by multi-camera motion tracking and reconstructed into 3D point clouds and motion trails, forming a digital archive of motion traces. Through this process, ReTracing serves as a novel approach to reveal how generative systems encode socio-cultural biases through choreographed movements.

We develop a QLSTM Seq2Seq autoencoder in which a depth-1 variational quantum circuit is embedded inside each recurrent gate, shaping the geometry of the learned latent manifold. Evaluated on fourteen rolling S and P 500 windows from 2022 to 2025, the quantum-enhanced encoder produces smoother trajectories, clearer regime transitions, and more stable, sector-coherent clusters than a classical LSTM baseline. These geometric properties support the use of a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel for downstream portfolio allocation, where both RBF-Graph and RBF-DivMom strategies consistently outperform their classical counterparts in risk-adjusted terms. Analysis across periods shows that compressed manifolds favor concentrated allocation, while dispersed manifolds favor diversification, demonstrating that latent geometry serves as a regime indicator. The results highlight a practical role for shallow hybrid quantum and classical layers in NISQ-era sequence modeling, offering a reproducible pathway for improving temporal embeddings in finance and other data-limited, noise-sensitive domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u6d45\u5c42\u91cf\u5b50\u5c42\u5982\u4f55\u6539\u8fdb\u65f6\u5e8f\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86QLSTM Seq2Seq\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u65f6\u5e8f\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u589e\u5f3a\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u652f\u6301RBF\u6838\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u6295\u8d44\u7ec4\u5408\u5206\u914d\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u63a2\u7d22\u5728NISQ\u65f6\u4ee3\uff0c\u6d45\u5c42\u91cf\u5b50\u5c42\u5982\u4f55\u6539\u8fdb\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u65f6\u5e8f\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u654f\u611f\u7684\u9886\u57df\u5982\u91d1\u878d\u4e2d\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u5426\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f18\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86QLSTM Seq2Seq\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5faa\u73af\u95e8\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e3a1\u7684\u53d8\u5206\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\uff0c\u4ee5\u5851\u9020\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u6d41\u5f62\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u57282022-2025\u5e74\u95f4\u768414\u4e2a\u6eda\u52a8S&P 500\u7a97\u53e3\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5f84\u5411\u57fa\u51fd\u6570(RBF)\u6838\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0b\u6e38\u6295\u8d44\u7ec4\u5408\u5206\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u91cf\u5b50\u589e\u5f3a\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6bd4\u7ecf\u5178LSTM\u57fa\u7ebf\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u3001\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u673a\u5236\u8f6c\u6362\u548c\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u884c\u4e1a\u4e00\u81f4\u805a\u7c7b\u3002RBF-Graph\u548cRBF-DivMom\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u98ce\u9669\u8c03\u6574\u540e\u8868\u73b0\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178\u5bf9\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u538b\u7f29\u6d41\u5f62\u6709\u5229\u4e8e\u96c6\u4e2d\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u5206\u6563\u6d41\u5f62\u6709\u5229\u4e8e\u591a\u6837\u5316\u5206\u914d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6d45\u5c42\u6df7\u5408\u91cf\u5b50-\u7ecf\u5178\u5c42\u5728NISQ\u65f6\u4ee3\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u6539\u8fdb\u91d1\u878d\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u654f\u611f\u9886\u57df\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u5d4c\u5165\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u3002\u6f5c\u5728\u6d41\u5f62\u51e0\u4f55\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u673a\u5236\u6307\u793a\u5668\u3002"}}

At each FC antenna, there is one fixed-position active antenna and multiple passive couplers that can move within a designated region around the active antenna. Moreover, each FC antenna is equipped with a local processing unit (LPU). All LPUs exchange signals with a central processing unit (CPU) for joint signal processing. We study an FC-aided multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system, where an FC array base station (BS) is deployed to enhance the downlink communication between the BS and multiple single-antenna users. We formulate optimization problems to maximize the achievable sum rate of users by jointly optimizing the coupler positions and digital beamforming, subject to movement constraints on the coupler positions and the transmit power constraint. To address the resulting nonconvex optimization problem, the digital beamforming is expressed as a function of the FC position vectors, which are then optimized using the proposed distributed coupler position optimization algorithm. Considering a structured time domain pattern of pilots and coupler positions, pilot-assisted centralized and distributed channel estimation algorithms are designed under the FC array architecture. Simulation results demonstrate that the distributed FC array achieves substantial rate gains over conventional benchmarks in multiuser systems without moving active antennas, and approaches the performance of fully active arrays while significantly reducing hardware cost and power consumption. Moreover, the proposed channel estimation algorithms outperform the benchmark schemes in terms of both pilot overhead and channel reconstruction accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u67d4\u6027\u8026\u5408\u5668\u9635\u5217\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u79fb\u52a8\u7684\u88ab\u52a8\u8026\u5408\u5668\u589e\u5f3a\u901a\u4fe1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u786c\u4ef6\u6210\u672c\u548c\u529f\u8017", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u7528\u6237MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u56fa\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u6709\u6e90\u5929\u7ebf\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u786c\u4ef6\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u529f\u8017\u5927\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u901a\u4fe1\u6027\u80fd\u53c8\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u786c\u4ef6\u6210\u672c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848", "method": "1. \u8bbe\u8ba1\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u67d4\u6027\u8026\u5408\u5668\u9635\u5217\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u6bcf\u4e2aFC\u5929\u7ebf\u5305\u542b\u4e00\u4e2a\u56fa\u5b9a\u6709\u6e90\u5929\u7ebf\u548c\u591a\u4e2a\u53ef\u5728\u6307\u5b9a\u533a\u57df\u5185\u79fb\u52a8\u7684\u88ab\u52a8\u8026\u5408\u5668\uff0c\u914d\u5907\u672c\u5730\u5904\u7406\u5355\u5143\uff1b2. \u5efa\u7acbFC\u8f85\u52a9\u591a\u7528\u6237MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\uff1b3. \u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u8026\u5408\u5668\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u5316\u7528\u6237\u53ef\u8fbe\u548c\u901f\u7387\uff1b4. \u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8026\u5408\u5668\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b5. \u8bbe\u8ba1\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff1a1. \u5206\u5e03\u5f0fFC\u9635\u5217\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u7528\u6237\u548c\u901f\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u83b7\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff1b2. \u63a5\u8fd1\u5168\u6709\u6e90\u9635\u5217\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u786c\u4ef6\u6210\u672c\u548c\u529f\u8017\uff1b3. \u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5bfc\u9891\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u4fe1\u9053\u91cd\u6784\u7cbe\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6848", "conclusion": "\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u67d4\u6027\u8026\u5408\u5668\u9635\u5217\u67b6\u6784\u4e3a\u591a\u7528\u6237MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u786c\u4ef6\u6210\u672c\u548c\u529f\u8017\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c"}}

We test leading open- and closed-source VidLMs and find that these models confidently describe reversed scenes as forward, answer questions while neglecting video content, agree with false claims, struggle with basic camera motion, and fail to aggregate temporal information amidst simple spatiotemporal masking. Humans, on the other hand, succeed at these tasks with ease.

This enables a wide variety of repeatable, quantifiable experiments which can compare ground-truth knowledge of virtual camera parameters and of virtual objects against the reconstructed estimations of those perspectives and subjects.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u4ece\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf3D\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u65b0\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u91cf\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u6444\u5f71\u6d4b\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6444\u5f71\u6d4b\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u62103D\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u3001\u53ef\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u57fa\u51c6", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a\u4ece\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf3D\u6a21\u578b\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5316\u751f\u6210\u7684\u76f8\u673a\u4f4d\u59ff\u521b\u5efa\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5efa\u7acb\u5305\u542b\u5730\u9762\u771f\u503c\uff08\u76f8\u673a\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u7269\u4f53\u4fe1\u606f\uff09\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u6570\u636e\u96c6", "result": "\u8be5\u6d41\u7a0b\u80fd\u591f\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u3001\u53ef\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u7cbe\u786e\u6bd4\u8f83\u91cd\u5efa\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bf9\u76f8\u673a\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u7269\u4f53\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u503c\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u503c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e3a\u6444\u5f71\u6d4b\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027"}}

While the capacity remains unchanged, the optimal probability of error for fixed message size and blocklength, in the NS-assisted causal CSIT setting can be further improved if channel state is made available to the receiver.

However, prior works largely rely on static statistics aggregated across datasets, identifying heads that perform retrieval on average. This perspective overlooks the fine-grained temporal dynamics of autoregressive generation. In this paper, we investigate retrieval heads from a dynamic perspective. Through extensive analysis, we establish three core claims: (1) Dynamism: Retrieval heads vary dynamically across timesteps; (2) Irreplaceability: Dynamic retrieval heads are specific at each timestep and cannot be effectively replaced by static retrieval heads; and (3) Correlation: The model's hidden state encodes a predictive signal for future retrieval head patterns, indicating an internal planning mechanism. We validate these findings on the Needle-in-a-Haystack task and a multi-hop QA task, and quantify the differences on the utility of dynamic and static retrieval heads in a Dynamic Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework. Our study provides new insights into the internal mechanisms of LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u4ece\u52a8\u6001\u89c6\u89d2\u7814\u7a76LLM\u4e2d\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u5934\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u68c0\u7d22\u5934\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u4e0a\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u53ef\u66ff\u4ee3\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u6a21\u578b\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u5305\u542b\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u68c0\u7d22\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5185\u90e8\u89c4\u5212\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u9759\u6001\u7edf\u8ba1\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u5e73\u5747\u6267\u884c\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u5934\u90e8\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u6027\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u4ece\u52a8\u6001\u89c6\u89d2\u7814\u7a76\u68c0\u7d22\u5934\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u89c4\u5f8b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5206\u6790\u5efa\u7acb\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u4e3b\u5f20\uff1a\u52a8\u6001\u6027\u3001\u4e0d\u53ef\u66ff\u4ee3\u6027\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002\u5728Needle-in-a-Haystack\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u591a\u8df3QA\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u91cf\u5316\u52a8\u6001\u4e0e\u9759\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u5934\u7684\u6548\u7528\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a1\uff09\u68c0\u7d22\u5934\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u4e0a\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\uff1b2\uff09\u52a8\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u5934\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u5177\u6709\u7279\u5f02\u6027\uff0c\u4e0d\u80fd\u88ab\u9759\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u5934\u6709\u6548\u66ff\u4ee3\uff1b3\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u7f16\u7801\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u68c0\u7d22\u5934\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5b58\u5728\u5185\u90e8\u89c4\u5212\u673a\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3aLLM\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u8003\u8651\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u6027\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u89c6\u89d2\u6bd4\u9759\u6001\u89c6\u89d2\u66f4\u80fd\u63ed\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002"}}

Deterministic replay recovers each recorded decision identifier exactly from stored artifacts, with all three identifying fields matching their persisted values. The contribution partitions representation space into persistence regions and boundaries, and treats decision reuse as a mechanically checkable condition.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u51b3\u7b56\u503c\u6620\u5c04\u6982\u5ff5\u548cDecisionDB\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bb0\u5f55\u3001\u91cd\u653e\u548c\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u540c\u8868\u793a\u5f62\u5f0f\u5bf9\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u6539\u53d8\u5173\u7cfb", "motivation": "\u76f8\u540c\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u8868\u793a\u5f62\u5f0f\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f15\u64ce\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8ffd\u8e2a\u54ea\u4e9b\u8868\u793a\u4fdd\u6301\u7ed3\u679c\u3001\u54ea\u4e9b\u6539\u53d8\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u51b3\u7b56\u91cd\u7528\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1", "method": "\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u51b3\u7b56\u503c\u6620\u5c04\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1DecisionDB\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5185\u5bb9\u8ba1\u7b97\u6807\u8bc6\u7b26\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ea\u5199\u5f62\u5f0f\u5b58\u50a8\u5de5\u4ef6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cd\u653e\u548c\u5ba1\u8ba1", "result": "\u5c06\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u6301\u4e45\u6027\u533a\u57df\u548c\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u673a\u68b0\u53ef\u68c0\u67e5\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u91cd\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6240\u6709\u4e09\u4e2a\u6807\u8bc6\u5b57\u6bb5\u4e0e\u6301\u4e45\u5316\u503c\u5b8c\u5168\u5339\u914d\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u91cd\u653e", "conclusion": "\u51b3\u7b56\u503c\u6620\u5c04\u548cDecisionDB\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ed3\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u91cd\u7528\u548c\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5212\u5206"}}

Existing representations either rely on UV maps, which suffer from distortion during unwrapping, or point-based methods, which tightly couple texture fidelity to geometric density that limits high-resolution texture generation. To address these limitations, we introduce TexSpot, a diffusion-based texture enhancement framework. At its core is Texlet, a novel 3D texture representation that merges the geometric expressiveness of point-based 3D textures with the compactness of UV-based representation. Each Texlet latent vector encodes a local texture patch via a 2D encoder and is further aggregated using a 3D encoder to incorporate global shape context. A cascaded 3D-to-2D decoder reconstructs high-quality texture patches, enabling the Texlet space learning. Leveraging this representation, we train a diffusion transformer conditioned on Texlets to refine and enhance textures produced by multi-view diffusion methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TexSpot significantly improves visual fidelity, geometric consistency, and robustness over existing state-of-the-art 3D texture generation and enhancement approaches.

The process is based on the solidification of photopolymer that occurs when a sufficient threshold dose of light-energy is absorbed. In order to create complex shapes, an illumination plan must be designed to force solidification in some desired areas while leaving other regions liquid. Determining an illumination plan can be considered as an optimisation problem where a variety of objective functionals (penalties) can be used. This work considers a selection of penalty functions and their impact on selected printing metrics; linking the shape of penalty functions to ranges of light-energy dose levels in in-part regions that should be printed and out-of-part regions that should remain liquid. Further, the threshold parameters that are typically used to demarcate minimum light-energy for in-part regions and maximum light-energy for out-of-part regions are investigated systematically as design parameters on both existing and new methods. This enables the characterisation of their effects on some selected printing metrics as well as informed selection for default values. This work is underpinned by a reproducible and extensible framework, TVAM Adaptive Illumination Design(TVAM AID), which makes use of the open-source Core Imaging Library(CIL) that is designed for tomographic imaging with an emphasis on reconstruction. The foundation of TVAM AID which is presented here can hence be easily enhanced by existing functionality in CIL thus lowering the barrier to entry and encouraging use of strategies that already exist for reconstruction optimisation.", "AI": {"tldr": "TVAM\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u5c42\u72b6\u65e0\u5c42\u5236\u9020\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u60e9\u7f5a\u51fd\u6570\u5bf9\u6253\u5370\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u9608\u503c\u53c2\u6570\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684TVAM AID\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "TVAM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u5feb\u901f\u5236\u9020\u590d\u6742\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4f18\u5316\u5149\u7167\u8ba1\u5212\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u805a\u5408\u7269\u56fa\u5316\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u786e\u5b9a\u5149\u7167\u8ba1\u5212\u65f6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u60e9\u7f5a\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u9608\u503c\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTVAM AID\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5f00\u6e90Core Imaging Library(CIL)\u8fdb\u884c\u5c42\u6790\u6210\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u4f18\u5316\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u540c\u60e9\u7f5a\u51fd\u6570\u5bf9\u6253\u5370\u6307\u6807\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u9608\u503c\u53c2\u6570\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u53ef\u91cd\u73b0\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u60e9\u7f5a\u51fd\u6570\u5f62\u72b6\u4e0e\u5149\u80fd\u5242\u91cf\u6c34\u5e73\u8303\u56f4\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8868\u5f81\u4e86\u9608\u503c\u53c2\u6570\u5bf9\u6253\u5370\u6307\u6807\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ed8\u8ba4\u503c\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eCIL\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55TVAM AID\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "conclusion": "TVAM AID\u6846\u67b6\u4e3aTVAM\u5149\u7167\u8ba1\u5212\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u60e9\u7f5a\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u9608\u503c\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6253\u5370\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eCIL\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u7279\u6027\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u95e8\u69db\u5e76\u9f13\u52b1\u91c7\u7528\u73b0\u6709\u91cd\u5efa\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

The key technical ingredient is the notion of multiple equal-difference (MED) representations of the defining set of a simple-root polynomial, which generalizes the MED representation of a cyclotomic coset. We prove that every MED representation induces an upper bound on the minimum distance; the classical Singleton bound corresponds to the coarsest representation, while the strongest among these bounds is defined as the arithmetic Singleton bound. It is shown that the arithmetic Singleton bound is always at least as tight as the Singleton bound, and a precise criterion for it to be strictly tighter is obtained. For irreducible constacyclic codes, the bound is given explicitly by $\u03c9+1$, where $\u03c9$ is a constant closely related to the order of $q$ modulo the radical of the polynomial order. This work provides the first systematic translation of arithmetic structure-via MED representations-into restrictive constraints on the minimum distance, revealing that the Singleton bound may be unattainable not because of linear limitations, but due to underlying algebraic obstructions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3a\u6709\u9650\u57df\u4e0a\u5355\u6839\u5e38\u5faa\u73af\u7801\u7684\u6c49\u660e\u8ddd\u79bb\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u4e0a\u754c\u2014\u2014\u7b97\u672fSingleton\u754c\uff0c\u8be5\u754c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u91cd\u7b49\u5dee\u8868\u793a\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u5bfc\u51fa\uff0c\u6bd4\u7ecf\u5178Singleton\u754c\u66f4\u7d27\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ecf\u5178Singleton\u754c\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u591f\u7d27\u81f4\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u5229\u7528\u5e38\u5faa\u73af\u7801\u7684\u7b97\u672f\u7ed3\u6784\u6765\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u63ed\u793aSingleton\u754c\u65e0\u6cd5\u8fbe\u5230\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u4ee3\u6570\u969c\u788d\u800c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u91cd\u7b49\u5dee\u8868\u793a\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u6765\u523b\u753b\u5355\u6839\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u7684\u5b9a\u4e49\u96c6\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u6bcf\u4e2aMED\u8868\u793a\u90fd\u80fd\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u6700\u5c0f\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u6700\u7d27\u81f4\u7684\u4e0a\u754c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u7b97\u672fSingleton\u754c\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e0d\u53ef\u7ea6\u5e38\u5faa\u73af\u7801\uff0c\u8be5\u754c\u7531\u03c9+1\u7ed9\u51fa\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u03c9\u4e0eq\u6a21\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u9636\u6839\u5f0f\u7684\u9636\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7b97\u672fSingleton\u754c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5b83\u603b\u662f\u81f3\u5c11\u4e0eSingleton\u754c\u4e00\u6837\u7d27\u81f4\uff0c\u5e76\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u5b83\u4e25\u683c\u66f4\u7d27\u81f4\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5224\u636e\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e0d\u53ef\u7ea6\u5e38\u5faa\u73af\u7801\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u663e\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u03c9+1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u5c06\u7b97\u672f\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u901a\u8fc7MED\u8868\u793a\uff09\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5bf9\u6700\u5c0f\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u9650\u5236\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86Singleton\u754c\u65e0\u6cd5\u8fbe\u5230\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u5e95\u5c42\u4ee3\u6570\u969c\u788d\u800c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u5e38\u5faa\u73af\u7801\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

We propose a lightweight approach based on encoder-transformers and conditional random fields to extract (nested) named entities from plasma physics research articles.

In blind settings, however, their use becomes significantly less stable due to the inherent non-convexity of the problem and the potential non-identifiability of the solutions. (Linear) minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimators provide a compelling alternative that can circumvent these limitations. In this work, we study synthetic two-dimensional blind deconvolution problems under fully controlled conditions, with complete prior knowledge of both the signal and kernel distributions. We compare tailored MAP algorithms with simple LMMSE estimators whose functional form is closely related to that of an optimal Tikhonov estimator. Our results show that, even in these highly controlled settings, MAP methods remain unstable and require extensive parameter tuning, whereas the LMMSE estimator yields a robust and reliable baseline. Moreover, we demonstrate empirically that the LMMSE solution can serve as an effective initialization for MAP approaches, improving their performance and reducing sensitivity to regularization parameters, thereby opening the door to future theoretical and practical developments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86MAP\u548cLMMSE\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u76f2\u53cd\u5377\u79ef\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5373\u4f7f\u5b8c\u5168\u5df2\u77e5\u5148\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\uff0cMAP\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ecd\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u4f18\uff0c\u800cLMMSE\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u521d\u59cb\u5316MAP\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5df2\u77e5\u524d\u5411\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\uff0cMAP\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u9009\u62e9\u5f88\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u76f2\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7531\u4e8e\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u975e\u51f8\u6027\u548c\u89e3\u7684\u975e\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\uff0cMAP\u53d8\u5f97\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002LMMSE\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u53ef\u4ee5\u89c4\u907f\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u76f2\u53cd\u5377\u79ef\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u5b8c\u5168\u53d7\u63a7\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e8c\u7ef4\u76f2\u53cd\u5377\u79ef\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5b8c\u5168\u5df2\u77e5\u4fe1\u53f7\u548c\u6838\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u3002\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u5b9a\u5236\u7684MAP\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0e\u7b80\u5355\u7684LMMSE\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u529f\u80fd\u5f62\u5f0f\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18Tikhonov\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u3002\u8fd8\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528LMMSE\u89e3\u4f5c\u4e3aMAP\u65b9\u6cd5\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u53d7\u63a7\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0cMAP\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ecd\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u4f18\uff0c\u800cLMMSE\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002LMMSE\u89e3\u4f5c\u4e3aMAP\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u80fd\u6539\u5584\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "LMMSE\u5728\u76f2\u53cd\u5377\u79ef\u4e2d\u6bd4MAP\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6709\u6548\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002LMMSE\u521d\u59cb\u5316MAP\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u63d0\u5347MAP\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u53d1\u5c55\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

We introduce RECOM (Reddit Evaluation for Correspondence of Models), a benchmark dataset of 15,000 recent Reddit questions from September 2025 paired with community-derived reference answers. We investigate how four open-source LLMs (Llama3.1-8B, Mistral-7B, Gemma-2-9B, and GPT-OSS-20B) respond to these questions, evaluating alignment using lexical metrics (BLEU, ROUGE), semantic similarity (BERTScore, MoverScore, cosine similarity), and logical inference (NLI). Our central finding is a striking semantic-lexical paradox: all models achieve over 99% cosine similarity with references despite less than 8% BLEU-1 overlap, a 90+ percentage point gap indicating that models preserve meaning through extensive paraphrasing rather than lexical reproduction. MoverScore (51-53%) confirms this pattern, occupying an intermediate position that reflects the optimal transport cost of semantic alignment. Furthermore, model scale does not predict performance: Mistral-7B (7B parameters) outperforms GPT-OSS-20B (20B parameters) across all metrics. NLI analysis reveals that contradiction rates remain below 7%, suggesting models rarely generate content that directly conflicts with human consensus. These findings challenge the reliability of lexical metrics for evaluating abstractive generation and argue for multi-dimensional evaluation frameworks that capture semantic fidelity beyond surface-level text matching.

Submitted to ICIP 2026", "summary": "Traditional monocular Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) systems struggle in low-texture environments where sparse visual features are insufficient for accurate pose estimation. To address this, dense Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) has been widely explored as a complementary information source. While recent Vision Transformer (ViT) based complex foundational models offer dense, geometrically consistent depth, their computational demands typically preclude them from real-time edge deployment. Our work bridges this gap by integrating learned depth priors directly into the VINS-Mono optimization backend. We propose a novel framework that enforces affine-invariant depth consistency and pairwise ordinal constraints, explicitly filtering unstable artifacts via variance-based gating.

To facilitate CRB analysis applicable to activity indicators, we relax the binary activity states to continuous parameters, thereby aligning the bound-based evaluation with practical threshold-based detection decisions. Closed-form CRB expressions are derived for two representative detection formulations, namely covariance-oriented and coherent models. Moreover, for single-antenna FASs, we obtain a closed-form coherent CRB by leveraging random matrix theory. The results demonstrate that CRB-based analysis provides a tractable and informative benchmark for evaluating activity detection across architectures and detection schemes, and further reveal that FASs can deliver strong spatial-diversity gains with significantly reduced complexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u514b\u62c9\u7f8e-\u7f57\u754c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u6d41\u4f53\u5929\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u4f20\u7edf\u56fa\u5b9a\u5929\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4f20\u8f93\u6d3b\u52a8\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u6027\u80fd\u6781\u9650\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4e8c\u5143\u6d3b\u52a8\u72b6\u6001\u677e\u5f1b\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u53c2\u6570\u6765\u9002\u5e94\u6d3b\u52a8\u6307\u793a\u5668\u7684CRB\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u6d41\u4f53\u5929\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u4f20\u7edf\u56fa\u5b9a\u5929\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u4f20\u8f93\u6d3b\u52a8\u68c0\u6d4b\u5efa\u7acb\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7CRB\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e0d\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u6027\u80fd\u6781\u9650\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u8bc4\u4f30FAS\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u96c6\u589e\u76ca\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u4e8c\u5143\u6d3b\u52a8\u72b6\u6001\u677e\u5f1b\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u53c2\u6570\u4ee5\u9002\u914dCRB\u5206\u6790\uff1b\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u5bfc\u5411\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u76f8\u5e72\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u7684\u95ed\u5f0fCRB\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff1b\u9488\u5bf9\u5355\u5929\u7ebfFAS\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u968f\u673a\u77e9\u9635\u7406\u8bba\u83b7\u5f97\u95ed\u5f0f\u76f8\u5e72CRB\u3002", "result": "CRB\u5206\u6790\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u6d3b\u52a8\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u4e14\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff1b\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660eFAS\u80fd\u591f\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u96c6\u589e\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7edf\u4e00\u7684CRB\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u8868\u5f81\u4e86FAS\u548cFPA\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6d3b\u52a8\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u6027\u80fd\u6781\u9650\uff0cCRB\u5206\u6790\u4e3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86FAS\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u96c6\u548c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

However, how the parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods affect hallucination behavior remains insufficiently understood, especially on QA datasets. In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of PEFT on hallucination detection through a comprehensive empirical study across three open-weight LLM backbones and three fact-seeking QA benchmarks. For each model, we evaluate performance using seven unsupervised hallucination detection methods spanning three complementary approaches: semantic consistency based detectors, confidence based detectors, and entropy based detectors. This multifaceted evaluation enables us to characterize how PEFT reshapes uncertainty across different detection paradigms. In conclusion, our experimental results show that PEFT consistently strengthens hallucination detection ability, substantially improving AUROC across a wide range of hallucination detectors. Besides, further analyses using linear probes and representation diagnostics indicate that PEFT methods primarily reshapes how uncertainty is encoded and surfaced, comparing with injecting new factual knowledge into the models.", "AI": {"tldr": "PEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u5851\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7f16\u7801\u800c\u975e\u6ce8\u5165\u65b0\u4e8b\u5b9e\u77e5\u8bc6", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03(PEFT)\u65b9\u6cd5\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7528\u4e8e\u9002\u914d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u901a\u5e38\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5bf9\u5e7b\u89c9\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u95ee\u7b54\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u7406\u89e3", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76PEFT\u5bf9\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90LLM\u4e3b\u5e72\u548c\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5bfb\u6c42QA\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e03\u79cd\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u548c\u71b5\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u6d4b\u548c\u8868\u793a\u8bca\u65ad\u8fdb\u884c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5206\u6790", "result": "PEFT\u4e00\u81f4\u5730\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5404\u79cd\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u7684AUROC\uff1bPEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u5851\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u8868\u73b0\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u5411\u6a21\u578b\u6ce8\u5165\u65b0\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u77e5\u8bc6", "conclusion": "PEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u5851\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8868\u793a\u673a\u5236\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3PEFT\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cdLLM\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u89c1\u89e3"}}

However, the foundational \"ground truth\" paradigm rests on a positivistic fallacy that treats human disagreement as technical noise rather than a vital sociotechnical signal. This systematic literature review analyzes research published between 2020 and 2025 across seven premier venues: ACL, AIES, CHI, CSCW, EAAMO, FAccT, and NeurIPS, investigating the mechanisms in data annotation practices that facilitate this \"consensus trap\". Our identification phase captured 30,897 records, which were refined via a tiered keyword filtration schema to a high-recall corpus of 3,042 records for manual screening, resulting in a final included corpus of 346 papers for qualitative synthesis. Our reflexive thematic analysis reveals that systemic failures in positional legibility, combined with the recent architectural shift toward human-as-verifier models, specifically the reliance on model-mediated annotations, introduce deep-seated anchoring bias and effectively remove human voices from the loop. We further demonstrate how geographic hegemony imposes Western norms as universal benchmarks, often enforced by the performative alignment of precarious data workers who prioritize requester compliance over honest subjectivity to avoid economic penalties. Critiquing the \"noisy sensor\" fallacy, where statistical models misdiagnose cultural pluralism as random error, we argue for reclaiming disagreement as a high-fidelity signal essential for building culturally competent models.

We characterize the regret achievable across three mechanism classes: Single-Price, Two-Price, and Segmented-Price.\n  For profit maximization, we design an algorithm using Two-Price Mechanisms that achieves $O(n^2 \\log\\log T)$ regret, where $n$ is the number of traders.\n  For GFT maximization, the optimal regret depends critically on both market size and mechanism expressiveness. Constant regret is achievable in bilateral trade, but this guarantee breaks down as the market grows: even in a one-seller, two-buyer market, any algorithm using Single-Price Mechanisms suffers regret at least $\u03a9\\!\\big(\\frac{\\log\\log T}{\\log\\log\\log\\log T}\\big)$, and we provide a nearly matching $O(\\log\\log T)$ upper bound for general one-to-many markets. In full many-to-many markets, we prove that Two-Price Mechanisms inevitably incur linear regret $\u03a9(T)$ due to a \\emph{mismatch phenomenon}, wherein inefficient pairings prevent near-optimal trade. To overcome this barrier, we introduce \\emph{Segmented-Price Mechanisms}, which partition traders into groups and assign distinct prices per group. Using this richer mechanism, we design an algorithm achieving $O(n^2 \\log\\log T + n^3)$ regret for GFT maximization.\n  Finally, we extend our results to the contextual setting, where traders' costs and values depend linearly on observed $d$-dimensional features that vary across rounds, obtaining regret bounds of $O(n^2 d \\log\\log T + n^2 d \\log d)$ for profit and $O(n^2 d^2 \\log T)$ for GFT. Our work delineates sharp boundaries between learnable and unlearnable regimes in two-sided dynamic pricing and demonstrates how modest increases in pricing expressiveness can circumvent fundamental hardness barriers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u53cc\u8fb9\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u5b9a\u4ef7\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u79cd\u5b9a\u4ef7\u673a\u5236\uff08\u5355\u4ef7\u683c\u3001\u53cc\u4ef7\u683c\u3001\u5206\u6bb5\u4ef7\u683c\uff09\u6700\u5927\u5316\u4ea4\u6613\u6536\u76ca\u6216\u5229\u6da6\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u5e02\u573a\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u673a\u5236\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\u4e0b\u7684\u9057\u61be\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u73af\u5883\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u53cc\u8fb9\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e8c\u5143\u63a5\u53d7/\u62d2\u7edd\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u5b9a\u4ef7\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u6700\u5927\u5316\u4ea4\u6613\u6536\u76ca\u6216\u5229\u6da6\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u540c\u5b9a\u4ef7\u673a\u5236\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5e02\u573a\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0b\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u52a0\u5b9a\u4ef7\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\u6765\u514b\u670d\u57fa\u672c\u56f0\u96be\u969c\u788d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u79cd\u5b9a\u4ef7\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u5355\u4ef7\u683c\u673a\u5236\u3001\u53cc\u4ef7\u683c\u673a\u5236\u548c\u5206\u6bb5\u4ef7\u683c\u673a\u5236\u3002\u4e3a\u5229\u6da6\u6700\u5927\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f7f\u7528\u53cc\u4ef7\u683c\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b\u4e3a\u4ea4\u6613\u6536\u76ca\u6700\u5927\u5316\u5f15\u5165\u5206\u6bb5\u4ef7\u683c\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5c06\u4ea4\u6613\u8005\u5206\u7ec4\u5e76\u4e3a\u6bcf\u7ec4\u5206\u914d\u4e0d\u540c\u4ef7\u683c\u3002\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u4ea4\u6613\u8005\u6210\u672c\u548c\u4ef7\u503c\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684d\u7ef4\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5229\u6da6\u6700\u5927\u5316\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u53cc\u4ef7\u683c\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0O(n\u00b2loglogT)\u9057\u61be\u3002\u4ea4\u6613\u6536\u76ca\u6700\u5927\u5316\uff1a\u53cc\u8fb9\u4ea4\u6613\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e38\u6570\u9057\u61be\uff0c\u4f46\u5355\u5356\u65b9\u53cc\u4e70\u65b9\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u5355\u4ef7\u683c\u673a\u5236\u81f3\u5c11\u03a9(loglogT/loglogloglogT)\u9057\u61be\uff0c\u4e00\u822c\u4e00\u5bf9\u591a\u5e02\u573a\u6709O(loglogT)\u4e0a\u754c\u3002\u591a\u5bf9\u591a\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u53cc\u4ef7\u683c\u673a\u5236\u56e0\u9519\u914d\u73b0\u8c61\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ebf\u6027\u9057\u61be\u03a9(T)\uff0c\u5206\u6bb5\u4ef7\u683c\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0O(n\u00b2loglogT+n\u00b3)\u9057\u61be\u3002\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u5229\u6da6\u9057\u61be\u4e3aO(n\u00b2d loglogT+n\u00b2d logd)\uff0c\u4ea4\u6613\u6536\u76ca\u9057\u61be\u4e3aO(n\u00b2d\u00b2 logT)\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u5212\u5b9a\u4e86\u53cc\u8fb9\u52a8\u6001\u5b9a\u4ef7\u4e2d\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u4e0d\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\u7684\u660e\u786e\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u9002\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u5b9a\u4ef7\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\u53ef\u4ee5\u89c4\u907f\u57fa\u672c\u56f0\u96be\u969c\u788d\u3002\u5206\u6bb5\u4ef7\u683c\u673a\u5236\u5728\u591a\u5bf9\u591a\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u53cc\u4ef7\u683c\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u9057\u61be\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ea4\u6613\u6536\u76ca\u6700\u5927\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Using the responses from FalseCite, we can also analyze the internal states of hallucinating models, visualizing and clustering the hidden state vectors.

Despite their success, aligning LLM-based evaluations with human judgments remains challenging. While supervised fine-tuning on human-labeled data can improve alignment, it is costly and inflexible, requiring new training for each task or dataset. Recent progress in auto prompt optimization (APO) offers a more efficient alternative by automatically improving the instructions that guide LLM judges. However, existing APO methods primarily target text-only evaluations and remain underexplored in multimodal settings. In this work, we study auto prompt optimization for multimodal LLM-as-a-judge, particularly for evaluating AI-generated images. We identify a key bottleneck: multimodal models can only process a limited number of visual examples due to context window constraints, which hinders effective trial-and-error prompt refinement. To overcome this, we propose BLPO, a bi-level prompt optimization framework that converts images into textual representations while preserving evaluation-relevant visual cues.

Here, envy-freeness up to any good (EFX) is a central fairness notion and resolving its existence is regarded as one of the most important open problems in this area of research. Two prominent relaxations of EFX are envy-freeness up to one good (EF1) and epistemic EFX (EEFX). While allocations satisfying each of these notions individually are known to exist even for general monotone valuations, whether both can be satisfied simultaneously remains open for all instances in which the EFX problem is itself unresolved.\n  In this work, we show that there always exists an allocation that is both EF1 (in fact, the stronger notion EFL) and EEFX for additive valuations, thereby resolving the primary open question raised by Akrami and Rathi (2025) and bringing us one step closer to resolving the elusive EFX problem. We introduce a new share-based fairness notion, termed strong EEFX share, which may be of independent interest and which implies EEFX feasibility of bundles.

Composite DNA extends this paradigm by leveraging mixtures of nucleotides to increase storage capacity beyond the four standard bases. In this work, we model composite DNA storage as a multinomial channel and draw an analogy to digital modulation by representing composite letters on the three-dimensional probability simplex. To mitigate errors caused by sampling randomness, we derive transition probabilities and log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) for each constellation point and employ practical channel codes for error correction. We then extend this framework to substitution and insertion-deletion (ID) channels, proposing constellation update rules that account for these additional impairments. Numerical results demonstrate that our approach achieves reliable performance with existing LDPC codes, compared to the prior schemes designed for limited-magnitude probability errors, whose performance degrades significantly under sampling randomness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u5408DNA\u5b58\u50a8\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u590d\u5408DNA\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u4fe1\u9053\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u7ef4\u6982\u7387\u5355\u7eaf\u5f62\u8868\u793a\u590d\u5408\u5b57\u6bcd\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u91c7\u6837\u968f\u673a\u6027\u3001\u66ff\u6362\u548c\u63d2\u5165-\u5220\u9664\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u7ea0\u9519\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "DNA\u6570\u636e\u5b58\u50a8\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3001\u957f\u671f\u5b58\u50a8\u65b9\u6848\u9762\u4e34\u6570\u5b57\u6570\u636e\u6307\u6570\u589e\u957f\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002\u590d\u5408DNA\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u6838\u82f7\u9178\u6df7\u5408\u7269\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u56db\u78b1\u57fa\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b58\u50a8\u5bb9\u91cf\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u91c7\u6837\u968f\u673a\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "1) \u5c06\u590d\u5408DNA\u5b58\u50a8\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u4fe1\u9053\uff1b2) \u5728\u4e09\u7ef4\u6982\u7387\u5355\u7eaf\u5f62\u4e0a\u8868\u793a\u590d\u5408\u5b57\u6bcd\uff08\u7c7b\u4f3c\u6570\u5b57\u8c03\u5236\u4e2d\u7684\u661f\u5ea7\u56fe\uff09\uff1b3) \u63a8\u5bfc\u6bcf\u4e2a\u661f\u5ea7\u70b9\u7684\u8f6c\u79fb\u6982\u7387\u548cLLR\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3\u91c7\u6837\u968f\u673a\u6027\u8bef\u5dee\uff1b4) \u4f7f\u7528\u5b9e\u7528\u4fe1\u9053\u7801\uff08LDPC\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u7ea0\u9519\uff1b5) \u6269\u5c55\u6846\u67b6\u5230\u66ff\u6362\u548c\u63d2\u5165-\u5220\u9664\u4fe1\u9053\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u661f\u5ea7\u66f4\u65b0\u89c4\u5219\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u4e3a\u6709\u9650\u5e45\u5ea6\u6982\u7387\u8bef\u5dee\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u65b9\u6848\uff08\u5728\u91c7\u6837\u968f\u673a\u6027\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff09\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u73b0\u6709LDPC\u7801\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u590d\u5408DNA\u5b58\u50a8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u9762\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u91c7\u6837\u968f\u673a\u6027\u3001\u66ff\u6362\u548c\u63d2\u5165-\u5220\u9664\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u4fe1\u9053\u635f\u4f24\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6807\u51c6\u4fe1\u9053\u7801\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u5b58\u50a8\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u590d\u5408DNA\u5b58\u50a8\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u5316\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

However, it remains a challenging problem in cases where the categories are unavailable, difficult to differentiate, or are interrelated. Social analysis with human context is an area that can benefit from text classification, as it relies substantially on text data. The focus of this paper is to enhance the classification of text according to the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by collecting and combining intelligence from multiple models. Combinatorial Fusion Analysis (CFA), a system fusion paradigm using a rank-score characteristic (RSC) function and cognitive diversity (CD), has been used to enhance classifier methods by combining a set of relatively good and mutually diverse classification models. We use a generative AI model to generate synthetic data for model training and then apply CFA to this classification task. The CFA technique achieves 96.73% performance, outperforming the best individual model. We compare the outcomes with those obtained from human domain experts. It is demonstrated that combining intelligence from multiple ML/AI models using CFA and getting input from human experts can, not only complement, but also enhance each other.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u7ec4\u5408\u878d\u5408\u5206\u6790(CFA)\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u4e2aAI\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u8054\u5408\u56fd\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u76ee\u6807(SDG)\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5408\u6210\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0cCFA\u8fbe\u523096.73%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u4e2a\u6700\u4f73\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ed3\u679c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7c7b\u522b\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u7c7b\u522b\u96be\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u6216\u76f8\u4e92\u5173\u8054\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u4ecd\u7136\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\u793e\u4f1a\u5206\u6790\u9886\u57df\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u91cf\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u8054\u5408\u56fd\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u76ee\u6807(SDG)\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "1. \u4f7f\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b2. \u5e94\u7528\u7ec4\u5408\u878d\u5408\u5206\u6790(CFA)\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u79e9-\u5f97\u5206\u7279\u5f81(RSC)\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u591a\u6837\u6027(CD)\u6765\u878d\u5408\u4e00\u7ec4\u76f8\u5bf9\u8f83\u597d\u4e14\u76f8\u4e92\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\uff1b3. \u5c06CFA\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u5bb6\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u7ed3\u679c\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "CFA\u6280\u672f\u5728SDG\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fbe\u523096.73%\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u4f73\u5355\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u4e2aML/AI\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u8f93\u5165\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u591f\u4e92\u8865\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u76f8\u4e92\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ec4\u5408\u878d\u5408\u5206\u6790(CFA)\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u591a\u4e2a\u76f8\u5bf9\u8f83\u597d\u4e14\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347SDG\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5408\u6210\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002CFA\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u540c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

To bridge this gap, we introduce AgentNoiseBench, a framework for systematically evaluating the robustness of agentic models under noisy environments. We first conduct an in-depth analysis of biases and uncertainties in real-world scenarios and categorize environmental noise into two primary types: user-noise and tool-noise. Building on this analysis, we develop an automated pipeline that injects controllable noise into existing agent-centric benchmarks while preserving task solvability. Leveraging this pipeline, we perform extensive evaluations across a wide range of models with diverse architectures and parameter scales.

Our approach orders the denoising trajectory by jointly processing latents and pixels with separately tuned noise schedules. This allows the latents to act as a scratchpad for intermediate computation before high-frequency pixel features are generated. We find that the order of conditioning signals is critical, and we analyze this to explain differences between REPA distillation in the tokenizer and the diffusion model, conditional versus unconditional generation, and how tokenizer reconstruction quality relates to diffusability.

Studying Pythia-family models, we discover a striking cross-over dissociation: angular perturbations cause up to 42.9 more damage to language modeling loss, while magnitude perturbations cause disproportionately more damage to syntactic processing (20.4% vs.1.6% accuracy drop on subject-verb agreement).This finding is enabled by L2-matched perturbation analysis, a methodology ensuring that an gular and magnitude perturbations achieve identical Euclidean displacements. Causal intervention reveals that angular damage flows substantially through the attention pathways (28.4% loss recovery via attention repair), while magnitude damage flows partly through the LayerNorm pathways(29.9% recovery via LayerNorm repair). These patterns replicate across scales within the Pythia architecture family. These findings provide evidence that direction and magnitude support partially distinct computational roles in LayerNorm based architectures. The direction preferentially affects attentional routing, while magnitude modulates processing intensity for fine-grained syntactic judgments.

Agentic reinforcement learning (RL) has recently emerged as a promising solution for training such agents in multi-turn settings, allowing interaction strategies to be learned from feedback. However, existing pipelines face a critical challenge in balancing task performance with user engagement, as passive agents can not efficiently adapt to users' intentions while overuse of human feedback reduces their satisfaction. To address this trade-off, we propose BAO, an agentic RL framework that combines behavior enhancement to enrich proactive reasoning and information-gathering capabilities with behavior regularization to suppress inefficient or redundant interactions and align agent behavior with user expectations. We evaluate BAO on multiple tasks from the UserRL benchmark suite, and demonstrate that it substantially outperforms proactive agentic RL baselines while achieving comparable or even superior performance to commercial LLM agents, highlighting its effectiveness for training proactive, user-aligned LLM agents in complex multi-turn scenarios.

To address this, we propose to leverage near-isotropic, higher resolution computed tomography angiography (CTA) data of the heart. We use this data to train a single neural implicit function to jointly represent cardiac shapes from CMRI at any resolution. We evaluate the method for the reconstruction of right ventricle (RV) and myocardium (MYO), where MYO simultaneously models endocardial and epicardial left-ventricle surfaces. Since high-resolution SAX reference segmentations are unavailable, we evaluate performance by extracting a 4-chamber (4CH) slice of RV and MYO from their reconstructed shapes. When compared with the reference 4CH segmentation masks from CMRI, our method achieved a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.91 $\\pm$ 0.07 and 0.75 $\\pm$ 0.13, and a Hausdorff distance of 6.21 $\\pm$ 3.97 mm and 7.53 $\\pm$ 5.13 mm for RV and MYO, respectively.

Yet, almost all fast convergence guarantees in learning in games require prior knowledge of the utility scale. To address this, we develop learning dynamics that achieve fast convergence while being both scale-free, requiring no prior information about utilities, and scale-invariant, remaining unchanged under positive rescaling of utilities. For two-player zero-sum games, we obtain scale-free and scale-invariant dynamics with external regret bounded by $\\tilde{O}(A_{\\mathrm{diff}})$, where $A_{\\mathrm{diff}}$ is the payoff range, which implies an $\\tilde{O}(A_{\\mathrm{diff}} / T)$ convergence rate to Nash equilibrium after $T$ rounds. For multiplayer general-sum games with $n$ players and $m$ actions, we obtain scale-free and scale-invariant dynamics with swap regret bounded by $O(U_{\\mathrm{max}} \\log T)$, where $U_{\\mathrm{max}}$ is the range of the utilities, ignoring the dependence on the number of players and actions. This yields an $O(U_{\\mathrm{max}} \\log T / T)$ convergence rate to correlated equilibrium. Our learning dynamics are based on optimistic follow-the-regularized-leader with an adaptive learning rate that incorporates the squared path length of the opponents' gradient vectors, together with a new stopping-time analysis that exploits negative terms in regret bounds without scale-dependent tuning. For general-sum games, scale-free learning is enabled also by a technique called doubling clipping, which clips observed gradients based on past observations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5728\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c3a\u5ea6\u65e0\u5173\u548c\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u6548\u7528\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5728\u96f6\u548c\u535a\u5f08\u548c\u4e00\u822c\u548c\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\u5206\u522b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5feb\u901f\u6536\u655b\u5230\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u5747\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u535a\u5f08\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u6548\u7528\u5c3a\u5ea6\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5f80\u5f80\u4e0d\u53ef\u5f97\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u65e2\u5c3a\u5ea6\u65e0\u5173\uff08\u65e0\u9700\u6548\u7528\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\uff09\u53c8\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0d\u53d8\uff08\u5728\u6548\u7528\u6b63\u7f29\u653e\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0d\u53d8\uff09\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e50\u89c2\u8ddf\u968f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\uff08Optimistic FTRL\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\uff0c\u8be5\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u5bf9\u624b\u68af\u5ea6\u5411\u91cf\u7684\u5e73\u65b9\u8def\u5f84\u957f\u5ea6\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e00\u822c\u548c\u535a\u5f08\uff0c\u8fd8\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\"\u52a0\u500d\u88c1\u526a\"\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5386\u53f2\u89c2\u6d4b\u503c\u5bf9\u68af\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u88c1\u526a\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u7684\u505c\u6b62\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u6790\u6765\u5229\u7528\u9057\u61be\u754c\u9650\u4e2d\u7684\u8d1f\u9879\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u5c3a\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u8c03\u53c2\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e24\u4eba\u96f6\u548c\u535a\u5f08\uff1a\u83b7\u5f97\u5c3a\u5ea6\u65e0\u5173\u4e14\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5916\u90e8\u9057\u61be\u754c\u4e3a$\\tilde{O}(A_{\\mathrm{diff}})$\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d$A_{\\mathrm{diff}}$\u662f\u6536\u76ca\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740\u7ecf\u8fc7$T$\u8f6e\u540e\u4ee5$\\tilde{O}(A_{\\mathrm{diff}} / T)$\u7684\u901f\u7387\u6536\u655b\u5230\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u591a\u4eba\u4e00\u822c\u548c\u535a\u5f08\uff1a\u83b7\u5f97\u5c3a\u5ea6\u65e0\u5173\u4e14\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u4ea4\u6362\u9057\u61be\u754c\u4e3a$O(U_{\\mathrm{max}} \\log T)$\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d$U_{\\mathrm{max}}$\u662f\u6548\u7528\u8303\u56f4\uff08\u5ffd\u7565\u73a9\u5bb6\u6570\u548c\u884c\u52a8\u6570\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740\u4ee5$O(U_{\\mathrm{max}} \\log T / T)$\u7684\u901f\u7387\u6536\u655b\u5230\u76f8\u5173\u5747\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u529f\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5728\u535a\u5f08\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c3a\u5ea6\u65e0\u5173\u548c\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u548c\u65b0\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u5148\u9a8c\u6548\u7528\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5feb\u901f\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u535a\u5f08\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To handle this limitation, we propose PRIME (Policy-Reinforced Iterative Multi-agent Execution), a framework comprising three specialized agents, an executor for step-by-step reasoning, a verifier for constraint checking, and a coordinator for backtracking control, optimized through group relative policy optimization. For comprehensive evaluation, we introduce PRIME-Bench, the largest algorithmic reasoning benchmark to date, comprising 86 tasks across 12 categories with 51,600 instances. Tasks span sorting algorithms, graph and tree structures, automata and state machines, symbolic reasoning, and constraint-based puzzles, with execution traces reaching over one million steps. Compared to baseline approach, PRIME improves average accuracy from 26.8% to 93.8%, a 250% relative gain. The largest improvements occur on tasks requiring sustained state tracking, with Turing machine simulation improving from 9% to 92% and long division from 16% to 94%. Ablation studies identify iterative verification as the primary contributor, preventing the error propagation that causes baseline approaches to fail catastrophically.

Yet existing methods struggle to jointly achieve three core goals: background preservation, geometric consistency under viewpoint shifts, and user-controllable transformations. Geometry-based approaches offer precise control but require explicit 3D reconstruction and generalize poorly; diffusion-based methods generalize better but lack fine-grained geometric control. We present Ctrl&Shift, an end-to-end diffusion framework to achieve geometry-consistent object manipulation without explicit 3D representations. Our key insight is to decompose manipulation into two stages, object removal and reference-guided inpainting under explicit camera pose control, and encode both within a unified diffusion process. To enable precise, disentangled control, we design a multi-task, multi-stage training strategy that separates background, identity, and pose signals across tasks. To improve generalization, we introduce a scalable real-world dataset construction pipeline that generates paired image and video samples with estimated relative camera poses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Ctrl&Shift achieves state-of-the-art results in fidelity, viewpoint consistency, and controllability.

We fully characterize the equilibrium behavior of shortlisted contestants for any given prize structure and shortlist size. We examine two objective functions: the highest individual performance and total performance. For both objectives, the optimal contest is in a winner-take-all format. For the highest individual performance, the optimal shortlist size is exactly two contestants, but, in contrast, for total performance, the shortlist size does not affect the outcome, i.e., any size yields the same total performance.

In this work, we study the design of communication rate-optimal device-to-device (D2D) coded caching schemes with minimal subpacketization levels, a key bottleneck in finite-length settings. We present a novel \\tit{packet type-based} (PT) design framework that (i) strategically introduces \\tit{asymmetry} into file splitting through user grouping, and (ii) systematically exploits such asymmetry in both cache placement and multicast delivery to create subpacketization reduction opportunities. In particular, the induced asymmetry gives rise to two fundamental forms of subpacketization reduction gains: the \\emph{subfile saving gain}, achieved by eliminating certain types of subfiles through careful user grouping and transmitter selection, and the \\emph{further splitting saving gain}, attained by reducing the splitting granularity for the remaining subfiles. The combined effect of these two reduction gains yields an overall subpacketization improvement over the original Ji-Caire-Molisch (JCM) caching scheme~\\cite{ji2016fundamental}, as well as various state-of-the-art schemes, while preserving optimal communication rates.\n  Under the PT framework, we formulate the caching scheme design as an integer linear program (ILP), where each feasible solution corresponds to a valid rate-optimal D2D coded caching scheme with potentially reduced subpacketization relative to the JCM baseline.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u7ec4\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u7528\u6237\u5206\u7ec4\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u6765\u964d\u4f4eD2D\u7f16\u7801\u7f13\u5b58\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u5b50\u5206\u7ec4\u5316\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6700\u4f18\u901a\u4fe1\u901f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u6709\u9650\u957f\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7f16\u7801\u7f13\u5b58\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u5f53\u524dD2D\u7f16\u7801\u7f13\u5b58\u65b9\u6848\u9762\u4e34\u5b50\u5206\u7ec4\u5316\u6c34\u5e73\u8fc7\u9ad8\u7684\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u6709\u9650\u957f\u5ea6\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u7ec4\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u901a\u8fc7\u7528\u6237\u5206\u7ec4\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u5730\u5f15\u5165\u6587\u4ef6\u5206\u5272\u7684\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff1b2) \u5728\u7f13\u5b58\u653e\u7f6e\u548c\u591a\u64ad\u4f20\u8f93\u4e2d\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u6765\u521b\u9020\u5b50\u5206\u7ec4\u5316\u51cf\u5c11\u673a\u4f1a\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u5305\u62ec\u5b50\u6587\u4ef6\u8282\u7701\u589e\u76ca\u548c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5206\u5272\u8282\u7701\u589e\u76ca\u4e24\u79cd\u673a\u5236\u3002\u5c06\u7f13\u5b58\u65b9\u6848\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u6574\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u76f8\u6bd4\u539f\u59cbJCM\u7f13\u5b58\u65b9\u6848\u4ee5\u53ca\u5404\u79cd\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6700\u4f18\u901a\u4fe1\u901f\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u603b\u4f53\u5b50\u5206\u7ec4\u5316\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u7ec4\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4eD2D\u7f16\u7801\u7f13\u5b58\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u5b50\u5206\u7ec4\u5316\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6709\u9650\u957f\u5ea6\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u7f16\u7801\u7f13\u5b58\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002"}}

While object-centric representations provide a useful abstraction, they are not sufficient to capture interaction-dependent dynamics. We therefore propose C-JEPA, a simple and flexible object-centric world model that extends masked joint embedding prediction from image patches to object-centric representations. By applying object-level masking that requires an object's state to be inferred from other objects, C-JEPA induces latent interventions with counterfactual-like effects and prevents shortcut solutions, making interaction reasoning essential. Empirically, C-JEPA leads to consistent gains in visual question answering, with an absolute improvement of about 20\\% in counterfactual reasoning compared to the same architecture without object-level masking. On agent control tasks, C-JEPA enables substantially more efficient planning by using only 1\\% of the total latent input features required by patch-based world models, while achieving comparable performance. Finally, we provide a formal analysis demonstrating that object-level masking induces a causal inductive bias via latent interventions.

Unfortunately, for regular distributions, adding $m$ additional buyers is sometimes indeed necessary, so the \"competition complexity\" of the VCG auction is $m$. We seek proving better competition complexity results in two dimensions.\n  First, under stronger distributional assumptions, the competition complexity of VCG auction drops dramatically. In balanced markets (where $m=n$) with MHR distributions, it is sufficient to only add $(e^{1/e} - 1 + o(1))n \\approx 0.4447n$ additional buyers to match the optimal revenue -- less than half the number that is necessary under regularity -- and this bound is asymptotically tight. We provide both exact finite-market results for small value of $n$, and closed-form asymptotic formulas for general market with any $m\\leq n$, and any target fraction of the optimal revenue.\n  Second, we analyze a supply-limiting variant of VCG auction that caps the number of units sold in a prior-independent way. Whenever the goal is to achieve almost the optimal revenue, this mechanism strictly improves upon standard VCG auction, requiring significantly fewer additional buyers.\n  Together, our results show that both stronger distributional assumptions, as well as a simple prior-independent refinement to the VCG auction, can each substantially reduce the number of additional buyers that is sufficient to achieve (near-)optimal revenue.

This study investigates the performance of the Gemini 2.5 Flash TTS and Gemini 2.5 Pro TTS models in generating synthetic courtroom speeches across five Indic languages: Tamil, Telugu, Bengali, Hindi, and Gujarati. We propose a prompting framework that utilizes Gemini 2.5s native support for 5 languages and its context-aware pacing to produce distinct advocate personas. The evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has shifted the focus of TexttoSpeech (TTS) technology from basic intelligibility to context-aware, expressive synthesis. In the legal domain, synthetic speech must convey authority and a specific professional persona a task that becomes significantly more complex in the linguistically diverse landscape of India. The models exhibit a \"monotone authority,\" excelling at procedural information delivery but struggling with the dynamic vocal modulation and emotive gravitas required for persuasive advocacy.

Standard pruning methods fail to address this bottleneck: unstructured sparsity leaves activations dense, magnitude-based selection ignores runtime dynamics, and gradient-based methods impose prohibitive costs. We introduce GHOST (Grouped Hidden-state Output-aware Selection and Truncation), a structured pruning framework that approximates control-theoretic balanced truncation using only forward-pass statistics. By jointly measuring controllability and observability, GHOST rivals the fidelity of gradient-based methods without requiring backpropagation. As a highlight, on models ranging from 130M to 2.7B parameters, our approach achieves a 50\\% state-dimension reduction with approximately 1 perplexity point increase on WikiText-2.

We study the Pareto frontier of the set of seller-buyers ex-ante utilities, generated by all truthful mechanisms when buyers values are sampled independently and identically (i.i.d.). We first provide a complete structural characterization of the Pareto frontier under natural distributional assumptions. For example, when valuations are drawn i.i.d. from a distribution that is both regular and anti-MHR, every Pareto-optimal mechanism is a second-price auction with a reserve no larger than the monopoly reserve.\n  Building on this, we interpret the problem of picking a mechanism as a two-sided bargaining game, and analyze two canonical Pareto-optimal solutions from cooperative bargaining theory: the Kalai-Smorodinsky (KS) solution, and the Nash solution. We prove that when values are drawn i.i.d. from a distribution that is both regular and anti-MHR, in large markets both solutions yield near-optimal welfare. In contrast, under worst-case MHR distributions, their performance diverges sharply: the KS solution guarantees one-half of the optimal welfare, while the Nash solution might only achieve an arbitrarily small fraction of it. These results highlight the sensitivity of fairness-efficiency tradeoffs to distributional structure, and affirm the KS solution as the more robust notion of fairness for asymmetric two-sided markets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5355\u7269\u54c1\u62cd\u5356\u4e2d\u5356\u65b9\u4e0e\u4e70\u65b9\u4e8b\u524d\u6548\u7528\u7684\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u524d\u6cbf\uff0c\u5728\u4e70\u5bb6\u4f30\u503c\u72ec\u7acb\u540c\u5206\u5e03\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6700\u4f18\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u673a\u5236\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u53cc\u8fb9\u8bae\u4ef7\u535a\u5f08\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86Kalai-Smorodinsky\u89e3\u548cNash\u89e3\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u5e03\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u7684\u798f\u5229\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u7406\u89e3\u5728\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5355\u7269\u54c1\u62cd\u5356\u4e2d\uff0c\u5356\u65b9\u6536\u76ca\u4e0e\u4e70\u65b9\u603b\u5269\u4f59\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u6240\u6709\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5236\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5356\u65b9-\u4e70\u65b9\u4e8b\u524d\u6548\u7528\u96c6\u5408\u7684\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u524d\u6cbf\uff0c\u4e3a\u673a\u5236\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u673a\u5236\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u53cc\u8fb9\u8bae\u4ef7\u535a\u5f08\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e0d\u540c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6982\u5ff5\u5728\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u53cc\u8fb9\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u5728\u72ec\u7acb\u540c\u5206\u5e03\u4f30\u503c\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff0c\u5bf9\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u524d\u6cbf\u8fdb\u884c\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u8868\u5f81\u3002\u7279\u522b\u5730\uff0c\u5f53\u4f30\u503c\u6765\u81ea\u65e2\u6b63\u5219\u53c8\u53cdMHR\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u65f6\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6700\u4f18\u673a\u5236\u90fd\u662f\u5e26\u6709\u4e0d\u8d85\u8fc7\u5784\u65ad\u4fdd\u7559\u4ef7\u7684\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4ef7\u683c\u62cd\u5356\u3002\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u673a\u5236\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u53cc\u8fb9\u8bae\u4ef7\u535a\u5f08\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u5408\u4f5c\u8bae\u4ef7\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ecf\u5178\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\uff1aKalai-Smorodinsky\u89e3\u548cNash\u89e3\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u5e03\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u7684\u798f\u5229\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5f53\u4f30\u503c\u6765\u81ea\u65e2\u6b63\u5219\u53c8\u53cdMHR\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u65f6\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\uff0cKS\u89e3\u548cNash\u89e3\u90fd\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u798f\u5229\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5728\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u7684MHR\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e24\u8005\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff1aKS\u89e3\u4fdd\u8bc1\u81f3\u5c11\u6700\u4f18\u798f\u5229\u7684\u4e00\u534a\uff0c\u800cNash\u89e3\u53ef\u80fd\u53ea\u5b9e\u73b0\u4efb\u610f\u5c0f\u7684\u798f\u5229\u6bd4\u4f8b\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u516c\u5e73-\u6548\u7387\u6743\u8861\u5bf9\u5206\u5e03\u7ed3\u6784\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u5e76\u786e\u8ba4KS\u89e3\u5728\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u53cc\u8fb9\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u662f\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6982\u5ff5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5355\u7269\u54c1\u62cd\u5356\u7684\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u524d\u6cbf\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5356\u65b9\u4e0e\u4e70\u65b9\u6548\u7528\u6743\u8861\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cKalai-Smorodinsky\u89e3\u5728\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u53cc\u8fb9\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u6bd4Nash\u89e3\u66f4\u5177\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728MHR\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u798f\u5229\u4e0b\u754c\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u673a\u5236\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6982\u5ff5\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5206\u5e03\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u516c\u5e73-\u6548\u7387\u6743\u8861\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

Chaotic dynamical systems provide an especially demanding test because chaos is deterministic yet often misinterpreted as randomness or complexity. We introduce ChaosBench-Logic, a benchmark that evaluates LLM reasoning across 30 diverse dynamical systems using a unified first-order logic (FOL) ontology. Each system is annotated with truth assignments for 11 semantic predicates, and 621 questions are generated across seven reasoning categories, including multi-hop implications, cross-system analogies, counterfactual reasoning, bias probes, and multi-turn dialogues. We define metrics for logical accuracy, implication consistency, dialogue coherence, and contradiction, and we release an open-source evaluation pipeline. Initial experiments show that frontier LLMs such as GPT-4, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and the open-source LLaMA-3 70B achieve 91-94% per-item accuracy, yet still score 0% on compositional items and exhibit fragile global coherence. Dialogue-level accuracy ranges from 53.1% (GPT-4 CoT) to 75.5% (LLaMA-3 zero-shot).

Recent work frames this task as automatic text generation, underusing author expertise and intent. In practice, authors possess domain expertise, author-only information, revision and response strategies--concrete forms of author expertise and intent--to address reviewer concerns, and seek NLP assistance that integrates these signals to support effective response writing in peer review. We reformulate author response generation as an author-in-the-loop task and introduce REspGen, a generation framework that integrates explicit author input, multi-attribute control, and evaluation-guided refinement, together with REspEval, a comprehensive evaluation suite with 20+ metrics covering input utilization, controllability, response quality, and discourse.

While existing methods typically rely on dedicated models for achieving specific compression ratios, they are often limited in flexibility and generalization. In particular, retraining is necessary when adapting to a new compression ratio. To address this limitation, we propose a novel and flexible Arbitrary Ratio Feature Compression (ARFC) framework, which supports any compression ratio with a single model, eliminating the need for multiple specialized models. At its core, the Arbitrary Ratio Compressor (ARC) is an auto-regressive model that performs compression via next-token prediction. This allows the compression ratio to be controlled at inference simply by adjusting the number of generated tokens. To enhance the quality of the compressed features, two key modules are introduced. The Mixture of Solutions (MoS) module refines the compressed tokens by utilizing multiple compression results (solutions), reducing uncertainty and improving robustness. The Entity Relation Graph Constraint (ERGC) is integrated into the training process to preserve semantic and structural relationships during compression. Extensive experiments on cross-modal retrieval, image classification, and image retrieval tasks across multiple datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches at various compression ratios. Notably, in some cases, it even surpasses the performance of the original, uncompressed features. These results validate the effectiveness and versatility of ARFC for practical, resource-constrained scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faARFC\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u652f\u6301\u4efb\u610f\u538b\u7f29\u6bd4\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u538b\u7f29\u6bd4\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u578b", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7279\u5f81\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u4e3a\u7279\u5b9a\u538b\u7f29\u6bd4\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5f53\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u538b\u7f29\u6bd4\u65f6\u5fc5\u987b\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3", "method": "\u63d0\u51faARFC\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u662f\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578bARC\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee4\u724c\u9884\u6d4b\u8fdb\u884c\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u538b\u7f29\u6bd4\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u4ee4\u724c\u6570\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\uff1b\u5f15\u5165MoS\u6a21\u5757\u5229\u7528\u591a\u4e2a\u538b\u7f29\u7ed3\u679c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u96c6\u6210ERGC\u7ea6\u675f\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5173\u7cfb", "result": "\u5728\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u538b\u7f29\u6bd4\u4e0b\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8fc7\u539f\u59cb\u672a\u538b\u7f29\u7279\u5f81\u6027\u80fd", "conclusion": "ARFC\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u591a\u529f\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u652f\u6301\u4efb\u610f\u538b\u7f29\u6bd4\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u538b\u7f29"}}

Recent advancements in deep learning have opened new avenues for compression; however, many existing approaches depend on dense vector representations that obscure the underlying token structure. To address these limitations, we propose a novel lossless compression method that leverages Reinforcement Learning applied to a T5 language model architecture. This approach enables the compression of data into sequences of tokens rather than traditional vector representations. Unlike auto-encoders, which typically encode information into continuous latent spaces, our method preserves the token-based structure, aligning more closely with the original data format. This preservation allows for higher compression ratios while maintaining semantic integrity. By training the model using an off-policy Reinforcement Learning algorithm, we optimize sequence length to minimize redundancy and enhance compression efficiency. Our method introduces an efficient and adaptive data compression system built upon advanced Reinforcement Learning techniques, functioning independently of external grammatical or world knowledge.

We quantify this script tax by comparing two orthographic variants with identical linguistic content. Across mBERT and XLM-R, the higher-fragmentation orthography shows a ~3.4x increase in fertility (6.73-6.85 vs. 2.10-2.35 tokens/word), leading to a 16.5x inference slowdown (0.23 vs. 3.8 sentences/second) on identical hardware. Using bits per character (BPC) to avoid the \"NLL paradox\" from subword fragmentation, we find a substantial increase in information cost: +19.7% for mBERT (8.06->9.65) and +47.1% for XLM-R (12.19->17.94). A round-trip conversion check (CER_rt=0.31) suggests these gaps reflect orthography-conditioned processing rather than mapping noise.

However, the reliability of this recipe in real-world settings remains unreliable due to environmental uncertainties arising from the sim-to-real gap, model mismatch, and system noise. We address this gap by introducing Distributionally robust IGM (DrIGM), a principle that requires each agent's robust greedy action to align with the robust team-optimal joint action. We show that DrIGM holds for a novel definition of robust individual action values, which is compatible with decentralized greedy execution and yields a provable robustness guarantee for the whole system. Building on this foundation, we derive DrIGM-compliant robust variants of existing value-factorization architectures (e.g., VDN/QMIX/QTRAN) that (i) train on robust Q-targets, (ii) preserve scalability, and (iii) integrate seamlessly with existing codebases without bespoke per-agent reward shaping. Empirically, on high-fidelity SustainGym simulators and a StarCraft game environment, our methods consistently improve out-of-distribution performance.

While the principal can theoretically extract the full social welfare using a discriminatory contract that tailors payments to individual costs, such contracts may be perceived as unfair. In this work, we introduce and analyze anonymous contracts, where payments depend solely on the total number of successes, ensuring identical treatment of agents.\n  We first establish that every anonymous contract admits a pure Nash equilibrium. However, because general anonymous contracts can suffer from multiple equilibria with unbounded gaps in principal utility, we identify uniform anonymous contracts as a desirable subclass. We prove that uniform anonymous contracts guarantee a unique equilibrium, thereby providing robust performance guarantees.\n  In terms of efficiency, we prove that under limited liability, anonymous contracts cannot generally approximate the social welfare better than a factor logarithmic in the spread of agent success probabilities. We show that uniform contracts are sufficient to match this theoretical limit. Finally, we demonstrate that removing limited liability significantly boosts performance: anonymous contracts generally achieve an $O(\\log n)$ approximation to the social welfare and, surprisingly, can extract the full welfare whenever agents' success probabilities are distinct. This reveals a structural reversal: widely spread probabilities are the hardest case under limited liability, whereas identical probabilities become the hardest case when limited liability is removed.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5951\u7ea6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u533f\u540d\u5951\u7ea6\uff08\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6210\u529f\u603b\u6570\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u516c\u5e73\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5747\u8861\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u3001\u552f\u4e00\u6027\u53ca\u6548\u7387\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u6709\u9650\u8d23\u4efb\u4e0e\u65e0\u9650\u8d23\u4efb\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u53cd\u8f6c\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6b67\u89c6\u6027\u5951\u7ea6\u867d\u80fd\u63d0\u53d6\u5168\u90e8\u793e\u4f1a\u798f\u5229\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u533f\u540d\u5951\u7ea6\uff08\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u76f8\u540c\u5f85\u9047\uff09\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6fc0\u52b1\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u533f\u540d\u5951\u7ea6\uff08\u652f\u4ed8\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u603b\u6210\u529f\u6570\uff09\u548c\u5747\u5300\u533f\u540d\u5951\u7ea6\u5b50\u7c7b\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u5747\u8861\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u3001\u552f\u4e00\u6027\uff1b\u5efa\u7acb\u6709\u9650\u8d23\u4efb\u4e0b\u7684\u5bf9\u6570\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e0b\u754c\uff1b\u7814\u7a76\u65e0\u9650\u8d23\u4efb\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "result": "1) \u6240\u6709\u533f\u540d\u5951\u7ea6\u5b58\u5728\u7eaf\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\uff1b2) \u5747\u5300\u533f\u540d\u5951\u7ea6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u552f\u4e00\u5747\u8861\uff1b3) \u6709\u9650\u8d23\u4efb\u4e0b\u533f\u540d\u5951\u7ea6\u6700\u591a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u6570\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff1b4) \u65e0\u9650\u8d23\u4efb\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0O(log n)\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u5f53\u6210\u529f\u6982\u7387\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u53ef\u63d0\u53d6\u5168\u90e8\u798f\u5229\uff1b5) \u53d1\u73b0\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u8d23\u4efb\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u53cd\u8f6c\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u533f\u540d\u5951\u7ea6\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4ecd\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u65e0\u9650\u8d23\u4efb\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff1b\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3001\u6fc0\u52b1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u8d23\u4efb\u7ea6\u675f\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\u3002"}}

By connecting these established theoretical frameworks, we provide an accessible and unified account of why current transformer architectures struggle to implement exact discrete algorithms, even as they excel at pattern matching and interpolation.

We explore multimodal RLVR through the lens of cross-modal attention connectivity and find that only a small fraction of tokens (approximately 15%) exhibit strong visual-textual coupling. These high-connectivity tokens act as anchors that ground reasoning in the image, while the majority follow linguistic patterns. During RLVR training, credit assignment naturally concentrates on these anchors, sharpening their visual grounding over time. Building on this insight, we propose Anchor-Token Reinforcement Learning (AT-RL), a lightweight framework that selectively reinforces high-connectivity tokens via graph-based clustering of attention topology. Evaluated across the series (3B-32B), AT-RL introduces only 1.2% overhead yet enables the 32B model to surpass the 72B-Instruct baseline on MathVista (80.2), with consistent gains observed across STEM, video and general tasks. Conversely, training solely on low-connectivity tokens causes severe degradation, confirming that effective multimodal RL hinges on precise credit assignment to visual anchors.

Journal version of VasoMIM (AAAI 2026)", "summary": "X-ray angiography is the gold standard imaging modality for cardiovascular diseases. However, current deep learning approaches for X-ray angiogram analysis are severely constrained by the scarcity of annotated data. While large-scale self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising solution, its potential in this domain remains largely unexplored, primarily due to the lack of effective SSL frameworks and large-scale datasets. To bridge this gap, we introduce a vascular anatomy-aware masked image modeling (VasoMIM) framework that explicitly integrates domain-specific anatomical knowledge. Specifically, VasoMIM comprises two key designs: an anatomy-guided masking strategy and an anatomical consistency loss. The former strategically masks vessel-containing patches to compel the model to learn robust vascular semantics, while the latter preserves structural consistency of vessels between original and reconstructed images, enhancing the discriminability of the learned representations. In conjunction with VasoMIM, we curate XA-170K, the largest X-ray angiogram pre-training dataset to date. We validate VasoMIM on four downstream tasks across six datasets, where it demonstrates superior transferability and achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods. These findings highlight the significant potential of VasoMIM as a foundation model for advancing a wide range of X-ray angiogram analysis tasks.

While cMGs expand the modeling frontier, their theoretical foundations, particularly the structure of Nash equilibria (NE) and guarantees for learning algorithms, are not yet well understood. In this work, we address these gaps for an extension of cMGs, which we term General Utility Markov Games (GUMGs), capturing new applications requiring coupling between agents' occupancy measures. We prove that in GUMGs, Nash equilibria coincide with the fixed points of projected pseudo-gradient dynamics (i.e., first-order stationary points), enabled by a novel agent-wise gradient domination property. This insight also yields a simple proof of NE existence using Brouwer's fixed-point theorem. We further show the existence of Markov perfect equilibria. Building on this characterization, we establish a policy gradient theorem for GUMGs and design a model-free policy gradient algorithm. For potential GUMGs, we establish iteration complexity guarantees for computing approximate-NE under exact gradients and provide sample complexity bounds in both the generative model and on-policy settings. Our results extend beyond prior work restricted to zero-sum cMGs, providing the first theoretical analysis of common-interest cMGs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5e7f\u4e49\u6548\u7528\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u535a\u5f08(GUMGs)\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u4e0e\u6295\u5f71\u4f2a\u68af\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u4e0d\u52a8\u70b9\u7684\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u5b9a\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u6f5c\u5728GUMGs\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u51f8\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u535a\u5f08(cMGs)\u867d\u7136\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff09\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7406\u8bba\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u80fd\u591f\u6355\u6349\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5360\u7528\u5ea6\u91cf\u8026\u5408\u7684\u65b0\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5e7f\u4e49\u6548\u7528\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u535a\u5f08(GUMGs)\u3002", "method": "1) \u8bc1\u660eGUMGs\u4e2d\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u4e0e\u6295\u5f71\u4f2a\u68af\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u4e0d\u52a8\u70b9\u7684\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u65b0\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7ea7\u68af\u5ea6\u652f\u914d\u6027\u8d28\uff1b2) \u4f7f\u7528Brouwer\u4e0d\u52a8\u70b9\u5b9a\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u8bc1\u660e\uff1b3) \u5efa\u7acbGUMGs\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u5b9a\u7406\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b4) \u9488\u5bf9\u6f5c\u5728GUMGs\uff0c\u5728\u7cbe\u786e\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u5efa\u7acb\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u540c\u7b56\u7565\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u754c\u9650\u3002", "result": "1) \u8bc1\u660e\u4e86GUMGs\u4e2d\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u4e0e\u4e00\u9636\u9a7b\u70b9\u7684\u7b49\u4ef7\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b2) \u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u5b8c\u7f8e\u5747\u8861\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u6027\uff1b3) \u5efa\u7acb\u4e86GUMGs\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u5b9a\u7406\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b4) \u4e3a\u6f5c\u5728GUMGs\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8fed\u4ee3\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u5148\u524d\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u96f6\u548ccMGs\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5e7f\u4e49\u6548\u7528\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u535a\u5f08(GUMGs)\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u575a\u5b9e\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5171\u540c\u5229\u76ca\u51f8\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u535a\u5f08\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5747\u8861\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u68af\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Code and dataset available at https://github.com/Privatris/AgentLeak", "summary": "Multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) systems create privacy risks that current benchmarks cannot measure. When agents coordinate on tasks, sensitive data passes through inter-agent messages, shared memory, and tool arguments; pathways that output-only audits never inspect. We introduce AgentLeak, to the best of our knowledge the first full-stack benchmark for privacy leakage covering internal channels, spanning 1,000 scenarios across healthcare, finance, legal, and corporate domains, paired with a 32-class attack taxonomy and three-tier detection pipeline. Testing GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Mistral Large, and Llama 3.3 70B across 4,979 traces reveals that multi-agent configurations reduce per-channel output leakage (C1: 27.2% vs 43.2% in single-agent) but introduce unmonitored internal channels that raise total system exposure to 68.9% (OR-aggregated across C1, C2, C5). Internal channels account for most of this gap: inter-agent messages (C2) leak at 68.8%, compared to 27.2% on C1 (output channel). This means that output-only audits miss 41.7% of violations. Claude 3.5 Sonnet, which emphasizes safety alignment in its design, achieves the lowest leakage rates on both external (3.3%) and internal (28.1%) channels, suggesting that model-level safety training may transfer to internal channel protection. Across all five models and four domains, the pattern C2 > C1 holds consistently, confirming that inter-agent communication is the primary vulnerability. These findings underscore the need for coordination frameworks that incorporate internal-channel privacy protections and enforce privacy controls on inter-agent communication.", "AI": {"tldr": "AgentLeak\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53LLM\u7cfb\u7edf\u5185\u90e8\u901a\u9053\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u7684\u5168\u6808\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8986\u76d61000\u4e2a\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5185\u90e8\u901a\u9053\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u95f4\u901a\u4fe1\uff09\u6bd4\u8f93\u51fa\u901a\u9053\u6cc4\u9732\u66f4\u591a\u654f\u611f\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u4ec5\u8f93\u51fa\u5ba1\u8ba1\u4f1a\u9057\u6f0f41.7%\u7684\u8fdd\u89c4\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53LLM\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u6d4b\u91cf\u8fd9\u4e9b\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u5f53\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u540c\u5b8c\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\uff0c\u654f\u611f\u6570\u636e\u4f1a\u901a\u8fc7\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u95f4\u6d88\u606f\u3001\u5171\u4eab\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u53c2\u6570\u7b49\u5185\u90e8\u901a\u9053\u4f20\u9012\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u901a\u9053\u5728\u4ec5\u8f93\u51fa\u5ba1\u8ba1\u4e2d\u4ece\u672a\u88ab\u68c0\u67e5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165AgentLeak\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b1000\u4e2a\u573a\u666f\uff08\u8986\u76d6\u533b\u7597\u3001\u91d1\u878d\u3001\u6cd5\u5f8b\u548c\u4f01\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\uff09\uff0c\u914d\u590732\u7c7b\u653b\u51fb\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u548c\u4e09\u5c42\u68c0\u6d4b\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u3002\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e86GPT-4o\u3001GPT-4o-mini\u3001Claude 3.5 Sonnet\u3001Mistral Large\u548cLlama 3.3 70B\u7b49\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e864979\u6761\u8ddf\u8e2a\u8bb0\u5f55\u3002", "result": "\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u914d\u7f6e\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6bcf\u901a\u9053\u8f93\u51fa\u6cc4\u9732\uff08C1: 27.2% vs \u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f5343.2%\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u76d1\u63a7\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u901a\u9053\u4f7f\u7cfb\u7edf\u603b\u66b4\u9732\u7387\u8fbe\u523068.9%\u3002\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u95f4\u6d88\u606f\uff08C2\uff09\u6cc4\u9732\u7387\u4e3a68.8%\uff0c\u8fdc\u9ad8\u4e8e\u8f93\u51fa\u901a\u9053\u768427.2%\u3002Claude 3.5 Sonnet\u5728\u5916\u90e8\uff083.3%\uff09\u548c\u5185\u90e8\uff0828.1%\uff09\u901a\u9053\u4e0a\u6cc4\u9732\u7387\u6700\u4f4e\u3002C2 > C1\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u90fd\u4e00\u81f4\u5b58\u5728\u3002", "conclusion": "\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u95f4\u901a\u4fe1\u662f\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53LLM\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u9690\u79c1\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u4ec5\u8f93\u51fa\u5ba1\u8ba1\u4f1a\u9057\u6f0f41.7%\u7684\u8fdd\u89c4\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u5305\u542b\u5185\u90e8\u901a\u9053\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u95f4\u901a\u4fe1\u4e0a\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u9690\u79c1\u63a7\u5236\u3002"}}

Efforts to reduce this exposure by lowering the radiotracer dose or scan time can degrade image quality. While using magnetic resonance (MR) images with clearer anatomical information to restore standard-dose PET (SPET) from low-dose PET (LPET) is a promising approach, it faces challenges with the inconsistencies in the structure and texture of multi-modality fusion, as well as the mismatch in out-of-distribution (OOD) data. In this paper, we propose a supervise-assisted multi-modality fusion diffusion model (MFdiff) for addressing these challenges for high-quality PET restoration. Firstly, to fully utilize auxiliary MR images without introducing extraneous details in the restored image, a multi-modality feature fusion module is designed to learn an optimized fusion feature. Secondly, using the fusion feature as an additional condition, high-quality SPET images are iteratively generated based on the diffusion model. Furthermore, we introduce a two-stage supervise-assisted learning strategy that harnesses both generalized priors from simulated in-distribution datasets and specific priors tailored to in-vivo OOD data. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed MFdiff effectively restores high-quality SPET images from multi-modality inputs and outperforms state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMFdiff\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u4f4e\u5242\u91cfPET\u548cMR\u56fe\u50cf\u6062\u590d\u6807\u51c6\u5242\u91cfPET\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u6a21\u6001\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6570\u636e\u95ee\u9898", "motivation": "PET\u6210\u50cf\u5b58\u5728\u8f90\u5c04\u66b4\u9732\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u5242\u91cf\u6216\u626b\u63cf\u65f6\u95f4\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5229\u7528MR\u56fe\u50cf\u8f85\u52a9\u6062\u590d\u6807\u51c6\u5242\u91cfPET\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u7eb9\u7406\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u4ee5\u53ca\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u7684\u6311\u6218", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u76d1\u7763\u8f85\u52a9\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b(MFdiff)\uff1a1) \u8bbe\u8ba1\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u878d\u5408\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528MR\u56fe\u50cf\u4f46\u4e0d\u5f15\u5165\u989d\u5916\u7ec6\u8282\uff1b2) \u4ee5\u878d\u5408\u7279\u5f81\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8fed\u4ee3\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cfSPET\uff1b3) \u5f15\u5165\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u76d1\u7763\u8f85\u52a9\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u62df\u5206\u5e03\u5185\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5e7f\u4e49\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u4f53\u5185\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u5148\u9a8c", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eMFdiff\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4ece\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u6062\u590d\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cfSPET\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5728\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5", "conclusion": "MFdiff\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001PET\u6062\u590d\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6570\u636e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f4e\u5242\u91cfPET\u6210\u50cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

While large language models (LLMs) have shown strong transfer capabilities across domains, adapting them to the AD domain through supervised fine-tuning remains largely unexplored. In this work, we fine-tune an LLM for AD detection and investigate how task-relevant information is encoded within its internal representations. We employ probing techniques to analyze intermediate activations across transformer layers, and we observe that, after fine-tuning, the probing values of specific words and special markers change substantially, indicating that these elements assume a crucial role in the model's improved detection performance. Guided by this insight, we design a curated set of task-aware special markers and train a sequence-to-sequence model as a data-synthesis tool that leverages these markers to generate structurally consistent and diagnostically informative synthetic samples.

However, most existing approaches primarily emphasize learning task-specific outputs or static knowledge representations, while overlooking the continuous refinement of internal reasoning structures, action scheduling policies, and learning mechanisms themselves. In this paper, we propose a human-inspired continuous learning framework that unifies reasoning, action, reflection, and verification within a sequential reasoning model enhanced by parallel learning. The framework explicitly treats internal thinking processes as primary learning objects. It systematically records internal reasoning trajectories and environmental interactions as structured learning material, enabling the system to optimize not only task-level content but also the organization, scheduling, and evolution of reasoning activities. This design realizes learning alongside processing, allowing cognitive structures to improve during execution. Furthermore, the framework supports controlled replacement of predefined logic with learned procedures and introduces a hierarchical learning-to-learn mechanism that jointly adapts task-level parameters and learning strategies. As a result, the system progressively evolves its internal cognitive architecture while preserving operational stability. Experimental results on a temperature sensor abnormality detection task show that incorporating internal-process learning reduces average runtime by 23.9%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u53d7\u4eba\u7c7b\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u884c\u52a8\u3001\u53cd\u601d\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7edf\u4e00\u5728\u5e76\u884c\u5b66\u4e60\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c06\u5185\u90e8\u601d\u7ef4\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u8981\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8ba4\u77e5\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6e10\u8fdb\u6f14\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u8f93\u51fa\u6216\u9759\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u5185\u90e8\u63a8\u7406\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u884c\u52a8\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\u672c\u8eab\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u800c\u5b66\u4e60\u5185\u90e8\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73b0\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u9002\u5e94\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u884c\u52a8\u3001\u53cd\u601d\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5185\u90e8\u601d\u7ef4\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u8981\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bb0\u5f55\u5185\u90e8\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u73af\u5883\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6750\u6599\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u903b\u8f91\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u53d7\u63a7\u66ff\u6362\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u5206\u5c42\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u7ea7\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6e29\u5ea6\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5185\u90e8\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u4f7f\u5e73\u5747\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8623.9%\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u64cd\u4f5c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6e10\u8fdb\u6f14\u5316\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u8ba4\u77e5\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5185\u90e8\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u8981\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5904\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4f7f\u8ba4\u77e5\u7ed3\u6784\u5728\u6267\u884c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5f97\u5230\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u9002\u5e94\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

This paper proposes a generative compression framework for perception-based denoising, where restoration is achieved by reconstructing from entropy-coded latent representations that enforce low-complexity structure, while generative decoders recover realistic textures via perceptual measures such as learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS) loss and Wasserstein distance. Two complementary instantiations are introduced: (i) a conditional Wasserstein GAN (WGAN)-based compression denoiser that explicitly controls the rate-distortion-perception (RDP) trade-off, and (ii) a conditional diffusion-based reconstruction strategy that performs iterative denoising guided by compressed latents. We further establish non-asymptotic guarantees for the compression-based maximum-likelihood denoiser under additive Gaussian noise, including bounds on reconstruction error and decoding error probability. Experiments on synthetic and real-noise benchmarks demonstrate consistent perceptual improvements while maintaining competitive distortion performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u538b\u7f29\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u53bb\u566a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u71b5\u7f16\u7801\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u5f3a\u5236\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u751f\u6210\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u6062\u590d\u771f\u5b9e\u7eb9\u7406\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u5931\u771f\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5931\u771f\u9a71\u52a8\u53bb\u566a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5f3a\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u5bb9\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7ed3\u6784\u7ec6\u8282\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u5e73\u8861\u5931\u771f\u3001\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u751f\u6210\u538b\u7f29\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u6761\u4ef6Wasserstein GAN\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u53bb\u566a\u5668\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u63a7\u5236\u7387-\u5931\u771f-\u611f\u77e5\u6743\u8861\uff1b2\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u538b\u7f29\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u6307\u5bfc\u8fed\u4ee3\u53bb\u566a\u3002\u4f7f\u7528LPIPS\u635f\u5931\u548cWasserstein\u8ddd\u79bb\u7b49\u611f\u77e5\u5ea6\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u566a\u58f0\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u5931\u771f\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6539\u8fdb\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u538b\u7f29\u7684\u6700\u5927\u4f3c\u7136\u53bb\u566a\u5668\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u975e\u6e10\u8fd1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u751f\u6210\u538b\u7f29\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u611f\u77e5\u53bb\u566a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u71b5\u7f16\u7801\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u5f3a\u5236\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u751f\u6210\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u6062\u590d\u771f\u5b9e\u7eb9\u7406\uff0c\u5728\u5931\u771f\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

The paper introduces a taxonomy of prompting paradigms, a decision framework for prompt selection based on varying factors for the practitioners, outlines emerging trends and challenges, and proposes a framework that links design, optimization, and evaluation to support more controllable and generalizable NLG.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u662f\u5173\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u7efc\u8ff0\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u68b3\u7406\u4e86\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u5206\u7c7b\u4f53\u7cfb\u3001\u51b3\u7b56\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8fde\u63a5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u9886\u57df\u4ecd\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u7edf\u4e00\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6563\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u6280\u672f\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u6548\u679c\u7684\u5168\u9762\u68b3\u7406\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u8be5\u6280\u672f\u7684\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u8fd1\u671f\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u63d0\u793a\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u4f53\u7cfb\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u9009\u62e9\u51b3\u7b56\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u8fde\u63a5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u4f53\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u8df5\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u6c42\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u8d44\u6e90\u7ea6\u675f\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u65b0\u5174\u8d8b\u52bf\u548c\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u53ef\u63a7\u548c\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f93\u5165\u7ea7\u63a7\u5236\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e0e\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u89e3\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f62\u6210\u4e92\u8865\uff0c\u5bf9\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63a8\u52a8\u66f4\u53ef\u63a7\u3001\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

To address these challenges, we propose CausalAgent, a conversational multi-agent system for end-to-end causal inference. The system innovatively integrates Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to achieve automation from data cleaning and causal structure learning to bias correction and report generation through natural language interaction. Users need only upload a dataset and pose questions in natural language to receive a rigorous, interactive analysis report. As a novel user-centered human-AI collaboration paradigm, CausalAgent explicitly models the analysis workflow. By leveraging interactive visualizations, it significantly lowers the barrier to entry for causal analysis while ensuring the rigor and interpretability of the process.", "AI": {"tldr": "CausalAgent\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5f0f\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u4ea4\u4e92\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5b8c\u6210\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u6e05\u6d17\u5230\u62a5\u544a\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u5206\u6790\u6d41\u7a0b", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u56e0\u679c\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u6280\u672f\u58c1\u5792\uff0c\u8981\u6c42\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u540c\u65f6\u5177\u5907\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u79d1\u5b66\u80cc\u666f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u624b\u52a8\u9009\u62e9\u7b97\u6cd5\u3001\u5904\u7406\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u89e3\u91ca\u590d\u6742\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u5728\u533b\u7597\u3001\u7ecf\u6d4e\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u79d1\u5b66\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCausalAgent\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u521b\u65b0\u6027\u5730\u6574\u5408\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08MAS\uff09\u3001\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u534f\u8bae\uff08MCP\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u4ea4\u4e92\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u6e05\u6d17\u3001\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u504f\u5dee\u6821\u6b63\u548c\u62a5\u544a\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u52a8\u5316", "result": "\u7528\u6237\u4ec5\u9700\u4e0a\u4f20\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5e76\u7528\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u95ee\uff0c\u5373\u53ef\u83b7\u5f97\u4e25\u8c28\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u5206\u6790\u62a5\u544a\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u56e0\u679c\u5206\u6790\u7684\u95e8\u69db\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u786e\u4fdd\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027", "conclusion": "CausalAgent\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u7528\u6237\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5f0f\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u56e0\u679c\u5206\u6790\u7684\u6280\u672f\u58c1\u5792\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u66f4\u52a0\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u548c\u5b9e\u7528"}}

Bidding algorithms that achieve optimal regret have been extensively studied, but their strategic robustness to the seller's manipulation remains relatively underexplored. Bidding algorithms based on no-swap-regret algorithms achieve both desirable properties, but are suboptimal in terms of statistical and computational efficiency. In contrast, online gradient ascent is the only algorithm that achieves $O(\\sqrt{TK})$ regret and strategic robustness [KSS24], where $T$ denotes the number of auctions and $K$ the number of bids.\n  In this paper, we explore whether simple online linear optimization (OLO) algorithms suffice for bidding algorithms with both desirable properties. Our main result shows that sublinear linearized regret is sufficient for strategic robustness. Specifically, we construct simple black-box reductions that convert any OLO algorithm into a strategically robust no-regret bidding algorithm, in both known and unknown value distribution settings. For the known value distribution case, our reduction yields a bidding algorithm that achieves $O(\\sqrt{T \\log K})$ regret and strategic robustness (with exponential improvement on the $K$-dependence compared to [KSS24]). For the unknown value distribution case, our reduction gives a bidding algorithm with high-probability $O(\\sqrt{T (\\log K+\\log(T/\u03b4)})$ regret and strategic robustness, while removing the bounded density assumption made in [KSS24].", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u91cd\u590d\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4e00\u4ef7\u62cd\u5356\u4e2d\u7684\u6295\u6807\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7ebf\u7ebf\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u6784\u5efa\u517c\u5177\u7b56\u7565\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6b21\u7ebf\u6027\u9057\u61be\u7684\u6295\u6807\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7edf\u8ba1\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u9057\u61be\u7684\u6295\u6807\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bf9\u5356\u5bb6\u64cd\u7eb5\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u65e0\u4ea4\u6362\u9057\u61be\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u517c\u5177\u4e24\u79cd\u7406\u60f3\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7edf\u8ba1\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u4e0d\u4f18\u3002\u5728\u7ebf\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5347\u662f\u552f\u4e00\u5b9e\u73b0O(\u221aTK)\u9057\u61be\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u6709\u6539\u8fdb\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u9ed1\u76d2\u5f52\u7ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u4efb\u4f55\u5728\u7ebf\u7ebf\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u65e0\u9057\u61be\u6295\u6807\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5df2\u77e5\u4ef7\u503c\u5206\u5e03\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5b9e\u73b0O(\u221aT log K)\u9057\u61be\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u672a\u77e5\u4ef7\u503c\u5206\u5e03\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6982\u7387O(\u221aT(log K+log(T/\u03b4)))\u9057\u61be\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6b21\u7ebf\u6027\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u9057\u61be\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8db3\u591f\u3002\u5728\u5df2\u77e5\u4ef7\u503c\u5206\u5e03\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u7b97\u6cd5\u9057\u61be\u4e3aO(\u221aT log K)\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4KSS24\u5728K\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u6539\u8fdb\uff1b\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u4ef7\u503c\u5206\u5e03\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6982\u7387O(\u221aT(log K+log(T/\u03b4)))\u9057\u61be\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u79fb\u9664\u4e86KSS24\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u754c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u7ebf\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u8db3\u4ee5\u6784\u5efa\u517c\u5177\u7b56\u7565\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6b21\u7ebf\u6027\u9057\u61be\u7684\u6295\u6807\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u9ed1\u76d2\u5f52\u7ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5df2\u77e5\u548c\u672a\u77e5\u4ef7\u503c\u5206\u5e03\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u90fd\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u9057\u61be\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cd\u590d\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4e00\u4ef7\u62cd\u5356\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Despite the success of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) in natural language processing and conventional vision tasks, directly applying PEFT to multi-agent settings leads to significant performance degradation and training instability. In this work, we conduct a detailed analysis and identify two key factors: (i) inter-frame redundancy in heterogeneous sensory streams, and (ii) erosion of fine-grained semantics in deep-layer representations under PEFT adaptation. To address these issues, we propose FlowAdapt, a parameter-efficient framework grounded in optimal transport theory, which minimizes information transport costs across both data distributions and network hierarchies. Specifically, we introduce a Wasserstein Greedy Sampling strategy to selectively filter redundant samples via a bounded covering radius. Furthermore, Progressive Knowledge Transfer module is designed to progressively inject compressed early-stage representations into later stages through learnable pathways, alleviating semantic degradation in late-stage adaptation.

Despite recent advances in multilingual modeling, LLMs often struggle in mixed-language settings, exhibiting systematic degradation in grammaticality, factuality, and safety behavior. This work provides a comprehensive overview of CSW research in modern large language model settings. We introduce a unifying taxonomy that organizes prior work along dimensions of data, modeling, and evaluation, and we distill these findings into a practical playbook of actionable recommendations for building, adapting, and evaluating CSW-capable LLMs. We review modeling approaches ranging from CSW-tailored pre-training and task-specific post-training to prompting strategies and in-context learning. We analyze current evaluation practices, highlighting sources of instability and limited reproducibility, and we catalog existing benchmarks while critically examining their linguistic coverage and English-centric biases. Finally, we discuss emerging safety concerns, including use of code-mixing as a mechanism for bypassing model safeguards, and identify open research challenges.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5168\u9762\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u7801\u8f6c\u6362\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u6784\u5efa\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bed\u7801\u8f6c\u6362\u80fd\u529bLLM\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5357\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b9e\u8df5\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u65b0\u5174\u5b89\u5168\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u53d6\u5f97\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u8bed\u8a00\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u8bed\u6cd5\u6027\u3001\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u9000\u5316\u3002\u8bed\u7801\u8f6c\u6362\u548c\u8bed\u7801\u6df7\u5408\u73b0\u8c61\u5bf9LLMs\u6784\u6210\u6301\u7eed\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u7edf\u4e00\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u3001\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7ec4\u7ec7\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\uff1b\u603b\u7ed3\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5357\uff1b\u7efc\u8ff0\u4ece\u8bed\u7801\u8f6c\u6362\u5b9a\u5236\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5230\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u5f53\u524d\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b9e\u8df5\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u6027\u9650\u5236\uff1b\u7f16\u76ee\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u5e76\u6279\u5224\u6027\u8003\u5bdf\u5176\u8bed\u8a00\u8986\u76d6\u548c\u82f1\u8bed\u4e2d\u5fc3\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8bed\u7801\u8f6c\u6362\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u5168\u9762\u6982\u89c8\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5357\uff1b\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u8986\u76d6\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u82f1\u8bed\u4e2d\u5fc3\u504f\u89c1\uff1b\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u8bed\u7801\u6df7\u5408\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ed5\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u9632\u62a4\u673a\u5236\u7684\u65b0\u5174\u5b89\u5168\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u7801\u8f6c\u6362\u5bf9LLMs\u4ecd\u662f\u91cd\u8981\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5357\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bed\u7801\u8f6c\u6362\u80fd\u529bLLMs\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u95ee\u9898\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u6311\u6218\u548c\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

However, while recent approaches have succeeded in constructing effective memories, they often disrupt the inherent logical and temporal relationships within interaction sessions, resulting in fragmented memory units and degraded reasoning performance. In this paper, we propose MetaMem, a novel framework that augments memory systems with a self-evolving meta-memory, aiming to teach LLMs how to effectively utilize memorized knowledge. During meta-memory optimization, MetaMem iteratively distills transferable knowledge utilization experiences across different tasks by self-reflecting on reasoning processes and performing actions to update the current meta-memory state. The accumulated meta-memory units serve as explicit knowledge utilization experiences, guiding the LLM to systematically identify and integrate critical evidence from scattered memory fragments. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of MetaMem, which significantly outperforms strong baselines by over 3.6%.

Most existing methods operate either in the image or post-log projection domain, which fails to fully exploit the rich structural information in pre-log measurements while being highly susceptible to noise. The requisite logarithmic transformation critically amplifies noise within these data, imposing exceptional demands on reconstruction precision. To overcome these challenges, we propose PLOT-CT, a novel framework for Pre-Log vOronoi decomposiTion-assisted CT generation. Our method begins by applying Voronoi decomposition to pre-log sinograms, disentangling the data into distinct underlying components, which are embedded in separate latent spaces. This explicit decomposition significantly enhances the model's capacity to learn discriminative features, directly improving reconstruction accuracy by mitigating noise and preserving information inherent in the pre-log domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PLOT-CT achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining a 2.36dB PSNR improvement over traditional methods at the 1e4 incident photon level in the pre-log domain.", "AI": {"tldr": "PLOT-CT\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u4f4e\u5242\u91cfCT\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u9884\u5bf9\u6570\u57df\u5e94\u7528Voronoi\u5206\u89e3\u5c06\u6570\u636e\u89e3\u8026\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u6210\u5206\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u6291\u5236\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f4e\u5242\u91cfCT\u91cd\u5efa\u9762\u4e34\u4e25\u91cd\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u6570\u636e\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u57df\u6216\u540e\u5bf9\u6570\u6295\u5f71\u57df\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u9884\u5bf9\u6570\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e2d\u7684\u4e30\u5bcc\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u6570\u53d8\u6362\u4f1a\u653e\u5927\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u5bf9\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u51fa\u6781\u9ad8\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPLOT-CT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u9884\u5bf9\u6570\u6b63\u5f26\u56fe\u4e0a\u5e94\u7528Voronoi\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u5c06\u6570\u636e\u89e3\u8026\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5e95\u5c42\u6210\u5206\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6210\u5206\u88ab\u5d4c\u5165\u5230\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u663e\u5f0f\u5206\u89e3\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u5224\u522b\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u901a\u8fc7\u6291\u5236\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u4fdd\u7559\u9884\u5bf9\u6570\u57df\u56fa\u6709\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u9884\u5bf9\u6570\u57df1e4\u5165\u5c04\u5149\u5b50\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0b\uff0cPLOT-CT\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e862.36dB\u7684PSNR\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "PLOT-CT\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u9884\u5bf9\u6570\u57df\u8fdb\u884cVoronoi\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f4e\u5242\u91cfCT\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u653e\u5927\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f4e\u5242\u91cfCT\u6210\u50cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In dynamic, partially observable environments, communication is often what reduces uncertainty and makes collaboration possible. This survey reviews multi-agent communication (MA-Comm) through the Five Ws: who communicates with whom, what is communicated, when communication occurs, and why communication is beneficial. This framing offers a clean way to connect ideas across otherwise separate research threads. We trace how communication approaches have evolved across three major paradigms. In Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), early methods used hand-designed or implicit protocols, followed by end-to-end learned communication optimized for reward and control. While successful, these protocols are frequently task-specific and hard to interpret, motivating work on Emergent Language (EL), where agents can develop more structured or symbolic communication through interaction. EL methods, however, still struggle with grounding, generalization, and scalability, which has fueled recent interest in large language models (LLMs) that bring natural language priors for reasoning, planning, and collaboration in more open-ended settings. Across MARL, EL, and LLM-based systems, we highlight how different choices shape communication design, where the main trade-offs lie, and what remains unsolved. We distill practical design patterns and open challenges to support future hybrid systems that combine learning, language, and control for scalable and interpretable multi-agent collaboration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u901a\u4fe1\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u6f14\u53d8\u5386\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ece\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u6d8c\u73b0\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u518d\u5230\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\"\u4e94\u4e2aW\"\u6846\u67b6\u5206\u6790\u901a\u4fe1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8981\u7d20\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u4fe1\u662f\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u5b9e\u73b0\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u5173\u952e\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6563\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8303\u5f0f\uff08MARL\u3001EL\u3001LLM\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u7406\u89e3\u901a\u4fe1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6f14\u53d8\u3001\u6743\u8861\u548c\u672a\u6765\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\"\u4e94\u4e2aW\"\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u8c01\u4e0e\u8c01\u901a\u4fe1\u3001\u901a\u4fe1\u5185\u5bb9\u3001\u901a\u4fe1\u65f6\u673a\u3001\u901a\u4fe1\u539f\u56e0\u3002\u4ee5\u6b64\u6846\u67b6\u8fde\u63a5\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u6d8c\u73b0\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u901a\u4fe1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6f14\u53d8\u5386\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u68b3\u7406\u4e86\u901a\u4fe1\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6f14\u53d8\uff1a\u4eceMARL\u4e2d\u7684\u624b\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1/\u9690\u5f0f\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5230\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u518d\u5230EL\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316/\u7b26\u53f7\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u5230LLM\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5148\u9a8c\u3002\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u5404\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u4f18\u7f3a\u70b9\uff1aMARL\u901a\u4fe1\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\uff0cEL\u5b58\u5728\u63a5\u5730\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0cLLM\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u901a\u4fe1\u7814\u7a76\u9700\u8981\u7ed3\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u65b0\u6df7\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

A unified judge loop evaluates final answers and simulates user responses as needed.

Yet existing RL post-training pipelines treat all input signals as equally relevant, ignoring which modalities each task actually requires. This modality-blind training inflates policy-gradient variance, slows convergence, and degrades robustness to real-world distribution shifts where signals may be missing, added, or reweighted. We introduce MAPLE, a complete modality-aware post-training and learning ecosystem comprising: (1) MAPLE-bench, the first benchmark explicitly annotating minimal signal combinations required per task; (2) MAPO, a modality-aware policy optimization framework that stratifies batches by modality requirement to reduce gradient variance from heterogeneous group advantages; (3) Adaptive weighting and curriculum scheduling that balances and prioritizes harder signal combinations. Systematic analysis across loss aggregation, clipping, sampling, and curriculum design establishes MAPO's optimal training strategy. Adaptive weighting and curriculum focused learning further boost performance across signal combinations. MAPLE narrows uni/multi-modal accuracy gaps by 30.24%, converges 3.18x faster, and maintains stability across all modality combinations under realistic reduced signal access.

We propose Normalized Logit Difference Decay (NLDD), a metric that measures whether individual reasoning steps are faithful to the model's decision-making process. Our approach corrupts individual reasoning steps from the explanation and measures how much the model's confidence in its answer drops, to determine if a step is truly important. By standardizing these measurements, NLDD enables rigorous cross-model comparison across different architectures. Testing three model families across syntactic, logical, and arithmetic tasks, we discover a consistent Reasoning Horizon (k*) at 70--85% of chain length, beyond which reasoning tokens have little or negative effect on the final answer. We also find that models can encode correct internal representations while completely failing the task.

By grounding LLMs in raw omics data, scPilot enables auditable, interpretable, and diagnostically informative single-cell analyses.\n  Code, data, and package are available at https://github.com/maitrix-org/scPilot", "code_url": "https://github.com/maitrix-org/scPilo", "AI": {"tldr": "scPilot\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec4\u5b66\u539f\u751f\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8ba9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u76f4\u63a5\u68c0\u67e5\u5355\u7ec6\u80deRNA-seq\u6570\u636e\u5e76\u8c03\u7528\u751f\u7269\u4fe1\u606f\u5b66\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5c06\u6838\u5fc3\u5355\u7ec6\u80de\u5206\u6790\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u9010\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5355\u7ec6\u80de\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u76f4\u63a5\u8bbf\u95ee\u539f\u59cb\u7ec4\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u900f\u660e\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\u8ba9LLM\u80fd\u591f\u57fa\u4e8e\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5206\u6790\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027", "method": "scPilot\u5c06\u5355\u7ec6\u80de\u5206\u6790\uff08\u7ec6\u80de\u7c7b\u578b\u6ce8\u91ca\u3001\u53d1\u80b2\u8f68\u8ff9\u91cd\u5efa\u3001\u8f6c\u5f55\u56e0\u5b50\u9776\u5411\uff09\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u9010\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8ba9LLM\u76f4\u63a5\u68c0\u67e5\u5355\u7ec6\u80deRNA-seq\u6570\u636e\u5e76\u6309\u9700\u8c03\u7528\u751f\u7269\u4fe1\u606f\u5b66\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8fed\u4ee3\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u8bc1\u636e\u4fee\u8ba2", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8fed\u4ee3\u7ec4\u5b66\u539f\u751f\u63a8\u7406\u4f7f\u7ec6\u80de\u7c7b\u578b\u6ce8\u91ca\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u534711%\uff0cGemini-2.5-Pro\u5c06\u8f68\u8ff9\u56fe\u7f16\u8f91\u8ddd\u79bb\u51cf\u5c1130%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u900f\u660e\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u75d5\u8ff9\u89e3\u91ca\u6807\u8bb0\u57fa\u56e0\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u548c\u8c03\u63a7\u903b\u8f91", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06LLM\u57fa\u4e8e\u539f\u59cb\u7ec4\u5b66\u6570\u636e\uff0cscPilot\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u8bca\u65ad\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u5355\u7ec6\u80de\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4e3a\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5206\u6790\u8303\u5f0f"}}

The three-dimensional discrete Gaussian representation (GR), which efficiently encodes 3D scenes using parameterized discrete Gaussian distributions, has shown promise in computer vision. In this work, we pro-pose a novel GR-Diffusion framework that synergistically integrates the geometric priors of GR with the generative power of diffusion models for 3D low-dose whole-body PET reconstruction. GR-Diffusion employs GR to generate a reference 3D PET image from projection data, establishing a physically grounded and structurally explicit benchmark that overcomes the low-pass limitations of conventional point-based or voxel-based methods. This reference image serves as a dual guide during the diffusion process, ensuring both global consistency and local accuracy. Specifically, we employ a hierarchical guidance mechanism based on the GR reference. Fine-grained guidance leverages differences to refine local details, while coarse-grained guidance uses multi-scale difference maps to correct deviations. This strategy allows the diffusion model to sequentially integrate the strong geometric prior from GR and recover sub-voxel information.

Existing misalignment benchmarks-such as INSECURE CODE (safety-centric), VALUEACTIONLENS (value-centric), and CULTURALHERITAGE (culture centric)-rely on evaluating misalignment along individual dimensions, preventing simultaneous evaluation. To address this gap, we introduce Mis-Align Bench, a unified benchmark for analyzing misalignment across safety, value, and cultural dimensions. First we constructs SAVACU, an English misaligned-aligned dataset of 382,424 samples spanning 112 domains (or labels), by reclassifying prompts from the LLM-PROMPT-DATASET via taxonomy into 14 safety domains, 56 value domains, and 42 cultural domains using Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, and expanding low-resource domains via Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct with SimHash-based fingerprint to avoid deduplication. Furthermore, we pairs prompts with misaligned and aligned responses via two-stage rejection sampling to enforce quality. Second we benchmarks general-purpose, fine-tuned, and open-weight LLMs, enabling systematic evaluation of misalignment under three dimensions. Empirically, single-dimension models achieve high Coverage (upto 97.6%) but incur False Failure Rate >50% and lower Alignment Score (63%-66%) under joint conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86Mis-Align Bench\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u4ef7\u503c\u548c\u6587\u5316\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u9519\u4f4d\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u57fa\u51c6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efaSAVACU\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08382,424\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\uff0c112\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\uff09\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5355\u4e00\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8054\u5408\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u5047\u5931\u8d25\u7387\u548c\u4f4e\u5bf9\u9f50\u5206\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9519\u4f4d\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\uff08\u5982INSECURE CODE\u3001VALUEACTIONLENS\u3001CULTURALHERITAGE\uff09\u4ec5\u9488\u5bf9\u5355\u4e00\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff08\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u4ef7\u503c\u6216\u6587\u5316\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u540c\u65f6\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5fc5\u987b\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u624d\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u5b9e\u9645\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6765\u540c\u65f6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u4ef7\u503c\u548c\u6587\u5316\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u9519\u4f4d\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "method": "1. \u6784\u5efaSAVACU\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1a\u4eceLLM-PROMPT-DATASET\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u7c7b\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3\u5c06\u5176\u5206\u4e3a14\u4e2a\u5b89\u5168\u9886\u57df\u300156\u4e2a\u4ef7\u503c\u9886\u57df\u548c42\u4e2a\u6587\u5316\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5171112\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u3002\u4f7f\u7528Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct\u901a\u8fc7SimHash\u6307\u7eb9\u907f\u514d\u91cd\u590d\u6765\u6269\u5c55\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u83b7\u5f97382,424\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u30022. \u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u62d2\u7edd\u91c7\u6837\u5c06\u63d0\u793a\u4e0e\u9519\u4f4d\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u914d\u5bf9\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u8d28\u91cf\u30023. \u5bf9\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5f00\u6e90\u6743\u91cd\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u9519\u4f4d\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5355\u4e00\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8054\u5408\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u867d\u7136\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u9ad8\u8fbe97.6%\uff0c\u4f46\u5047\u5931\u8d25\u7387\u8d85\u8fc750%\uff0c\u5bf9\u9f50\u5206\u6570\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0863%-66%\uff09\u3002\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u73b0\u6709\u5355\u4e00\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Mis-Align Bench\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u9519\u4f4d\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u540c\u65f6\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u4ef7\u503c\u548c\u6587\u5316\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u591a\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5355\u4e00\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u590d\u6742\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

A Mathematical Reasoning Evaluation", "comment": null, "summary": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on perception-oriented tasks, yet their ability to perform mathematical spatial reasoning, defined as the capacity to parse and manipulate two- and three-dimensional relations, remains unclear. Humans easily solve textbook-style spatial reasoning problems with over 95\\% accuracy, but we find that most leading MLLMs fail to reach even 60\\% on the same tasks. This striking gap highlights spatial reasoning as a fundamental weakness of current models. To investigate this gap, we present MathSpatial, a unified framework for evaluating and improving spatial reasoning in MLLMs. MathSpatial includes three complementary components: (i) MathSpatial-Bench, a benchmark of 2K problems across three categories and eleven subtypes, designed to isolate reasoning difficulty from perceptual noise; (ii) MathSpatial-Corpus, a training dataset of 8K additional problems with verified solutions; and (iii) MathSpatial-SRT, which models reasoning as structured traces composed of three atomic operations--Correlate, Constrain, and Infer. Experiments show that fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL-7B on MathSpatial achieves competitive accuracy while reducing tokens by 25\\%.

For safe driving in unexpected scenarios, these systems may additionally rely on human interventions such as natural language instructions. Using a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) facilitates human-vehicle interaction and can improve performance in such scenarios. However, this approach requires substantial computational resources due to its reliance on an LLM and numerous visual tokens from sensor inputs, which are limited in autonomous vehicles. Many MLLM studies have explored reducing visual tokens, but often suffer end-task performance degradation compared to using all tokens.\n  To enable efficient E2E driving while maintaining performance comparable to using all tokens, this paper proposes the first Supervised Token Reduction framework for multi-modal LLMs (SToRM). The proposed framework consists of three key elements. First, a lightweight importance predictor with short-term sliding windows estimates token importance scores. Second, a supervised training approach uses an auxiliary path to obtain pseudo-supervision signals from an all-token LLM pass. Third, an anchor-context merging module partitions tokens into anchors and context tokens, and merges context tokens into relevant anchors to reduce redundancy while minimizing information loss. Experiments on the LangAuto benchmark show that SToRM outperforms state-of-the-art E2E driving MLLMs under the same reduced-token budget, maintaining all-token performance while reducing computational cost by up to 30x.", "AI": {"tldr": "SToRM\uff1a\u9996\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5f0ftoken\u7f29\u51cf\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u4f2a\u76d1\u7763\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u951a\u70b9-\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5408\u5e76\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5168token\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5c06\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e\u9ad8\u8fbe30\u500d", "motivation": "\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u610f\u5916\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u7c7b\u5e72\u9884\uff08\u5982\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\uff09\uff0c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLM\uff09\u80fd\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4eba\u8f66\u4ea4\u4e92\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u5927\uff0c\u73b0\u6709token\u7f29\u51cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e38\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSToRM\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u901a\u8fc7\u77ed\u671f\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u4f30\u8ba1token\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5206\u6570\uff1b2\uff09\u76d1\u7763\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u8f85\u52a9\u8def\u5f84\u4ece\u5168token LLM\u4f20\u9012\u83b7\u53d6\u4f2a\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b3\uff09\u951a\u70b9-\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5408\u5e76\u6a21\u5757\u5c06token\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u951a\u70b9\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587token\uff0c\u5c06\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587token\u5408\u5e76\u5230\u76f8\u5173\u951a\u70b9\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59", "result": "\u5728LangAuto\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cSToRM\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u7f29\u51cftoken\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u9a7e\u9a76MLLM\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u5168token\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5c06\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e\u9ad8\u8fbe30\u500d", "conclusion": "SToRM\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5f0ftoken\u7f29\u51cf\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u9a7e\u9a76\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2dMLLM\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u95ee\u9898"}}

In this work, we focus on behavioral dispositions$-$the underlying tendencies that shape responses in social contexts$-$and introduce a framework to study how closely the dispositions expressed by LLMs align with those of humans. Our approach is grounded in established psychological questionnaires but adapts them for LLMs by transforming human self-report statements into Situational Judgment Tests (SJTs). These SJTs assess behavior by eliciting natural recommendations in realistic user-assistant scenarios. We generate 2,500 SJTs, each validated by three human annotators, and collect preferred actions from 10 annotators per SJT, from a large pool of 550 participants. In a comprehensive study involving 25 LLMs, we find that models often do not reflect the distribution of human preferences: (1) in scenarios with low human consensus, LLMs consistently exhibit overconfidence in a single response; (2) when human consensus is high, smaller models deviate significantly, and even some frontier models do not reflect the consensus in 15-20% of cases; (3) traits can exhibit cross-LLM patterns, e.g., LLMs may encourage emotion expression in contexts where human consensus favors composure. Lastly, mapping psychometric statements directly to behavioral scenarios presents a unique opportunity to evaluate the predictive validity of self-reports, revealing considerable gaps between LLMs' stated values and their revealed behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u884c\u4e3a\u503e\u5411\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u95ee\u5377\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u60c5\u5883\u5224\u65ad\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0LLM\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u503e\u5411\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5728\u4f4e\u5171\u8bc6\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u81ea\u4fe1\u3001\u5728\u9ad8\u5171\u8bc6\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u79bb\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u81ea\u6211\u62a5\u544a\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u884c\u4e3a\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740LLM\u878d\u5165\u65e5\u5e38\u751f\u6d3b\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u884c\u4e3a\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7a76LLM\u5728\u793e\u4ea4\u60c5\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u503e\u5411\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u503e\u5411\u7684\u5339\u914d\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u95ee\u5377\u5f00\u53d1\u60c5\u5883\u5224\u65ad\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5c06\u4eba\u7c7b\u81ea\u6211\u62a5\u544a\u9648\u8ff0\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3aSJTs\uff0c\u521b\u5efa2,500\u4e2a\u7ecf\u8fc7\u4e09\u4f4d\u4eba\u7c7b\u6807\u6ce8\u8005\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684SJTs\uff0c\u4ece550\u540d\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u4e2d\u6536\u96c6\u6bcf\u4e2aSJT\u7684\u504f\u597d\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5bf925\u4e2aLLM\u8fdb\u884c\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0LLM\u884c\u4e3a\u503e\u5411\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u5206\u5e03\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff1a1) \u5728\u4eba\u7c7b\u5171\u8bc6\u4f4e\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0cLLM\u5bf9\u5355\u4e00\u56de\u5e94\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8fc7\u5ea6\u81ea\u4fe1\uff1b2) \u5728\u4eba\u7c7b\u5171\u8bc6\u9ad8\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u663e\u8457\u504f\u79bb\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u524d\u6cbf\u6a21\u578b\u572815-20%\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u672a\u80fd\u53cd\u6620\u5171\u8bc6\uff1b3) \u7279\u8d28\u5448\u73b0\u8de8LLM\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5982LLM\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u514b\u5236\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9f13\u52b1\u60c5\u7eea\u8868\u8fbe\uff1b4) \u81ea\u6211\u62a5\u544a\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u884c\u4e3a\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u503e\u5411\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5171\u8bc6\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u60c5\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86LLM\u81ea\u6211\u62a5\u544a\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u884c\u4e3a\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5728LLM\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u8003\u8651\u884c\u4e3a\u503e\u5411\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback relies on preference annotations that are prohibitively expensive and often fail to reflect the absolute correctness of medical facts. Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards lacks effective automatic verifiers and struggles to handle complex clinical contexts. Meanwhile, medical alignment requires the simultaneous optimization of correctness, safety, and compliance, yet multi-objective heterogeneous reward signals are prone to scale mismatch and optimization conflicts.To address these challenges, we propose a robust medical alignment paradigm. We first construct a holistic multi-dimensional medical alignment matrix that decomposes alignment objectives into four categories: fundamental capabilities, expert knowledge, online feedback, and format specifications. Within each category, we establish a closed loop of where observable metrics inform attributable diagnosis, which in turn drives optimizable rewards, thereby providing fine-grained, high-resolution supervision signals for subsequent iterative optimization. To resolve gradient domination and optimization instability problem caused by heterogeneous signals, we further propose a unified optimization mechanism. This mechanism employs Reference-Frozen Normalization to align reward scales and implements a Tri-Factor Adaptive Dynamic Weighting strategy to achieve collaborative optimization that is weakness-oriented, risk-prioritized, and redundancy-reducing. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed paradigm in real-world medical scenario evaluations, establishing a new paradigm for complex alignment in vertical domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u533b\u7597\u95ee\u7b54\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u5bf9\u9f50\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u7ef4\u533b\u7597\u5bf9\u9f50\u77e9\u9635\u548c\u7edf\u4e00\u4f18\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edfRLHF\u548cRLVR\u5728\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u9f50\u8303\u5f0f\uff08RLHF\u548cRLVR\uff09\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u533b\u7597\u95ee\u7b54\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u6027\u8303\u5f0f\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff1aRLHF\u4f9d\u8d56\u6602\u8d35\u504f\u597d\u6807\u6ce8\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u53cd\u6620\u533b\u7597\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7edd\u5bf9\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff1bRLVR\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6709\u6548\u81ea\u52a8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff1b\u533b\u7597\u5bf9\u9f50\u9700\u8981\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u5408\u89c4\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5f02\u8d28\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u51b2\u7a81", "method": "1. \u6784\u5efa\u6574\u4f53\u591a\u7ef4\u533b\u7597\u5bf9\u9f50\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u5c06\u5bf9\u9f50\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u56db\u4e2a\u7c7b\u522b\uff1a\u57fa\u7840\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u4e13\u5bb6\u77e5\u8bc6\u3001\u5728\u7ebf\u53cd\u9988\u548c\u683c\u5f0f\u89c4\u8303\uff1b2. \u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7c7b\u522b\u4e2d\u5efa\u7acb\u95ed\u73af\uff1a\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6307\u6807\u2192\u53ef\u5f52\u56e0\u8bca\u65ad\u2192\u53ef\u4f18\u5316\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b3. \u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u4f18\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u91c7\u7528\u53c2\u8003\u51bb\u7ed3\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5bf9\u9f50\u5956\u52b1\u5c3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b9e\u65bd\u4e09\u56e0\u5b50\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u52a8\u6001\u52a0\u6743\u7b56\u7565\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f31\u70b9\u5bfc\u5411\u3001\u98ce\u9669\u4f18\u5148\u3001\u5197\u4f59\u51cf\u5c11\u7684\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u8303\u5f0f\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u533b\u7597\u573a\u666f\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4e3a\u5782\u76f4\u9886\u57df\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5bf9\u9f50\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u533b\u7597\u5bf9\u9f50\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u591a\u7ef4\u5bf9\u9f50\u77e9\u9635\u548c\u7edf\u4e00\u4f18\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\u7279\u6709\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u5782\u76f4\u9886\u57df\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u6846\u67b6"}}

We employ a hierarchical emotion representation with rich learnable prototypes that evolve during training, enabling fine-grained emotional control without requiring explicit emotion labels.

We show that self-referential vocabulary tracks concurrent activation dynamics, and that this correspondence is specific to self-referential processing. We introduce the Pull Methodology, a protocol that elicits extended self-examination through format engineering, and use it to identify a direction in activation space that distinguishes self-referential from descriptive processing in Llama 3.1. The direction is orthogonal to the known refusal direction, localised at 6.25% of model depth, and causally influences introspective output when used for steering. When models produce \"loop\" vocabulary, their activations exhibit higher autocorrelation (r = 0.44, p = 0.002); when they produce \"shimmer\" vocabulary under steering, activation variability increases (r = 0.36, p = 0.002).

Its critical application lies in cluttered environments, where occlusions, limited viewpoints, and noisy masks degrade perception. To address these challenges, we present Clutt3R-Seg, a zero-shot pipeline for robust 3D instance segmentation for language-grounded grasping in cluttered scenes. Our key idea is to introduce a hierarchical instance tree of semantic cues. Unlike prior approaches that attempt to refine noisy masks, our method leverages them as informative cues: through cross-view grouping and conditional substitution, the tree suppresses over- and under-segmentation, yielding view-consistent masks and robust 3D instances. Each instance is enriched with open-vocabulary semantic embeddings, enabling accurate target selection from natural language instructions. To handle scene changes during multi-stage tasks, we further introduce a consistency-aware update that preserves instance correspondences from only a single post-interaction image, allowing efficient adaptation without rescanning. Clutt3R-Seg is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world datasets, and validated on a real robot. Across all settings, it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in cluttered and sparse-view scenarios. Even on the most challenging heavy-clutter sequences, Clutt3R-Seg achieves an AP@25 of 61.66, over 2.2x higher than baselines, and with only four input views it surpasses MaskClustering with eight views by more than 2x.

However, their problem-solving ability often declines on more complex tasks due to hallucinations and the accumulation of errors within these intermediate steps. Recent work has introduced the notion of critical tokens--tokens in the reasoning process that exert significant influence on subsequent steps. Prior studies suggest that replacing critical tokens can refine reasoning trajectories. Nonetheless, reliably identifying and exploiting critical tokens remains challenging. To address this, we propose the Paraphrastic Probing and Consistency Verification~(PPCV) framework. PPCV operates in two stages. In the first stage, we roll out an initial reasoning path from the original question and then concatenate paraphrased versions of the question with this reasoning path. And we identify critical tokens based on mismatches between the predicted top-1 token and the expected token in the reasoning path. A criterion is employed to confirm the final critical token. In the second stage, we substitute critical tokens with candidate alternatives and roll out new reasoning paths for both the original and paraphrased questions. The final answer is determined by checking the consistency of outputs across these parallel reasoning processes. We evaluate PPCV on mainstream LLMs across multiple benchmarks.

Score inflation and selective reporting have eroded the authority of standard benchmarks, leaving the community uncertain about which evaluation results remain trustworthy. We introduce the Benchmark Health Index (BHI), a pure data-driven framework for auditing evaluation sets along three orthogonal and complementary axes: (1) Capability Discrimination, measuring how sharply a benchmark separates model performance beyond noise; (2) Anti-Saturation, estimating remaining headroom before ceiling effects erode resolution and thus the benchmark's expected longevity; and (3) Impact, quantifying influence across academic and industrial ecosystems via adoption breadth and practice-shaping power. By distilling 106 validated benchmarks from the technical reports of 91 representative models in 2025, we systematically characterize the evaluation landscape. BHI is the first framework to quantify benchmark health at a macro level, providing a principled basis for benchmark selection and enabling dynamic lifecycle management for next-generation evaluation protocols.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u51c6\u5065\u5eb7\u6307\u6570\uff08BHI\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u6b63\u4ea4\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff08\u80fd\u529b\u533a\u5206\u5ea6\u3001\u6297\u9971\u548c\u6027\u3001\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\uff09\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u5065\u5eb7\u72b6\u51b5\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u65e5\u76ca\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u5206\u6570\u81a8\u80c0\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u62a5\u544a\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u524a\u5f31\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u6743\u5a01\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u793e\u533a\u96be\u4ee5\u5224\u65ad\u54ea\u4e9b\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u503c\u5f97\u4fe1\u8d56\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5ba1\u8ba1\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u5065\u5eb7\u72b6\u51b5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u51c6\u5065\u5eb7\u6307\u6570\uff08BHI\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff1a1\uff09\u80fd\u529b\u533a\u5206\u5ea6\uff1a\u8861\u91cf\u57fa\u51c6\u533a\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff1b2\uff09\u6297\u9971\u548c\u6027\uff1a\u4f30\u8ba1\u57fa\u51c6\u5728\u8fbe\u5230\u9971\u548c\u6548\u5e94\u524d\u7684\u5269\u4f59\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b3\uff09\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u91c7\u7528\u5e7f\u5ea6\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u5851\u9020\u80fd\u529b\u91cf\u5316\u57fa\u51c6\u5728\u5b66\u672f\u548c\u5de5\u4e1a\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u4ece91\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u7684106\u4e2a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u57fa\u51c6\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "BHI\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u5728\u5b8f\u89c2\u5c42\u9762\u91cf\u5316\u57fa\u51c6\u5065\u5eb7\u5ea6\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u57fa\u51c6\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u539f\u5219\u6027\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u7ba1\u7406\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u5206\u67902025\u5e74\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u683c\u5c40\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u57fa\u51c6\u5065\u5eb7\u72b6\u51b5\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "BHI\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6307\u5bfc\u57fa\u51c6\u9009\u62e9\u5e76\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u5065\u5eb7\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Prior work on egocentric gaze estimation, which predicts device wearer's gaze location within the camera's field of view, mainly focuses on head-mounted cameras while alternative viewpoints remain underexplored. To bridge this gap, we collect the first dataset for this task, consisting of approximately 4 hours of video collected from 8 participants during everyday activities. We evaluate a transformer-based gaze estimation model, GLC, on the new dataset and propose two extensions: an auxiliary gaze out-of-bound classification task and a multi-view co-learning approach that jointly trains head-view and neck-view models using a geometry-aware auxiliary loss. Experimental results show that incorporating gaze out-of-bound classification improves performance over standard fine-tuning, while the co-learning approach does not yield gains.

Chang"], "title": "Right for the Wrong Reasons: Epistemic Regret Minimization for Causal Rung Collapse in LLMs", "comment": "18 pages, 6 tables, 3 figures", "summary": "Machine learning systems that are \"right for the wrong reasons\" achieve high performance through shortcuts that collapse under distributional shift. We show this pathology has a precise causal origin: autoregressive training provides no gradient signal to distinguish association P(Y|X) from intervention P(Y|do(X)), a failure we formalize as Rung Collapse. When outcome-based learning reinforces correct answers obtained through incorrect causal models, the agent becomes entrenched in flawed reasoning, a phenomenon we term Aleatoric Entrenchment. We propose Epistemic Regret Minimization (ERM), a belief revision objective that penalizes errors in causal reasoning independently of task success, and embed it within a three-layer architecture with three contributions grounded in knowledge representation: (1) a Physical Grounding Theorem proving that actions satisfying actuator independence implement valid do-operations, bridging action languages and do-calculus; (2) ERM as a causal belief revision operator satisfying AGM postulates, preventing entrenchment even when the agent succeeds for the wrong reasons; and (3) a failure mode taxonomy that classifies recurring reasoning errors and injects domain-independent guards, enabling cross-domain transfer. We prove asymptotic recovery of the true interventional distribution with finite-sample bounds. Experiments on 1,360 causal trap scenarios across six frontier LLMs reveal that Rung Collapse persists even in reasoning-enhanced models (3.7% for GPT-5.2), that steerability exhibits inverse scaling where advanced models resist generic correction, and that targeted ERM feedback recovers 53-59% of entrenched errors where outcome-level feedback fails.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faRung Collapse\u7406\u8bba\u89e3\u91ca\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\"\u6b63\u786e\u4f46\u7406\u7531\u9519\u8bef\"\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1Epistemic Regret Minimization\u65b9\u6cd5\u9632\u6b62\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u9519\u8bef\u56fa\u5316\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u5c42\u67b6\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u56e0\u679c\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4fee\u6b63\u3002", "motivation": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e38\u901a\u8fc7\"\u6377\u5f84\"\u83b7\u5f97\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6377\u5f84\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5316\u65f6\u4f1a\u5931\u6548\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e00\u75c5\u7406\u6709\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u8d77\u6e90\uff1a\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u5173\u8054P(Y|X)\u548c\u5e72\u9884P(Y|do(X))\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u9519\u8bef\u88ab\u56fa\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEpistemic Regret Minimization\u4f5c\u4e3a\u56e0\u679c\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4fee\u6b63\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e09\u5c42\u67b6\u6784\uff1a1)\u7269\u7406\u63a5\u5730\u5b9a\u7406\u8bc1\u660e\u6ee1\u8db3\u6267\u884c\u5668\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548do\u64cd\u4f5c\uff1b2)ERM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6ee1\u8db3AGM\u516c\u8bbe\u7684\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4fee\u6b63\u7b97\u5b50\uff1b3)\u6545\u969c\u6a21\u5f0f\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u6ce8\u5165\u9886\u57df\u65e0\u5173\u9632\u62a4\u3002\u8bc1\u660e\u771f\u5b9e\u5e72\u9884\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u6062\u590d\u3002", "result": "\u57286\u4e2a\u524d\u6cbfLLM\u76841,360\u4e2a\u56e0\u679c\u9677\u9631\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff1aRung Collapse\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728(GPT-5.2\u4e3a3.7%)\uff1b\u53ef\u64cd\u7eb5\u6027\u5448\u73b0\u9006\u7f29\u653e\u73b0\u8c61\uff1b\u9488\u5bf9\u6027ERM\u53cd\u9988\u80fd\u6062\u590d53-59%\u7684\u56fa\u5316\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u800c\u7ed3\u679c\u5c42\u9762\u53cd\u9988\u5931\u8d25\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e86Rung Collapse\u4f5c\u4e3a\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u51faERM\u65b9\u6cd5\u9632\u6b62Aleatoric Entrenchment\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56e0\u679c\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4fee\u6b63\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u5206\u5e03\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u771f\u6b63\u7406\u89e3\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Even state-of-the-art models fail to capture topology and symbolic logic in engineering schematics, as their pixel-driven paradigm discards the explicit vector-defined relations needed for reasoning. To overcome this, we propose a Vector-to-Graph (V2G) pipeline that converts CAD diagrams into property graphs where nodes represent components and edges encode connectivity, making structural dependencies explicit and machine-auditable. On a diagnostic benchmark of electrical compliance checks, V2G yields large accuracy gains across all error categories, while leading MLLMs remain near chance level. These results highlight the systemic inadequacy of pixel-based methods and demonstrate that structure-aware representations provide a reliable path toward practical deployment of multimodal AI in engineering domains.

As a result, text-to-shape retrieval has become essential in facilitating intuitive search within large repositories. However, existing methods require canonical poses and support few object categories, limiting their real-world applicability where objects can belong to diverse classes and appear in random orientations. To address this challenge, we propose RI-Mamba, the first rotation-invariant state-space model for point clouds. RI-Mamba defines global and local reference frames to disentangle pose from geometry and uses Hilbert sorting to construct token sequences with meaningful geometric structure while maintaining rotation invariance. We further introduce a novel strategy to compute orientational embeddings and reintegrate them via feature-wise linear modulation, effectively recovering spatial context and enhancing model expressiveness. Our strategy is inherently compatible with state-space models and operates in linear time. To scale up retrieval, we adopt cross-modal contrastive learning with automated triplet generation, allowing training on diverse datasets without manual annotation. Extensive experiments demonstrate RI-Mamba's superior representational capacity and robustness, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the OmniObject3D benchmark across more than 200 object categories under arbitrary orientations.

Analysis of model confidence dynamics under latent reasoning reveals that thinking trajectories ending in incorrect answers contain fewer low-confidence steps than those ending in correct answers. Meanwhile, we suggest that soft embeddings aggregated by multiple low-confidence thinking alternatives may introduce and propagate noise, leading to high confidence in unreliable reasoning trajectories. Motivated by these observations, ThinkRouter, an inference-time confidence-aware routing mechanism is proposed to avoid high confidence and noise for efficient reasoning. ThinkRouter routes thinking to the discrete token space when model confidence is low, and to the latent space otherwise. Extensive experiments on STEM reasoning and coding benchmarks across diverse large reasoning models demonstrate that ThinkRouter outperforms explicit CoT, random routing, and latent reasoning baselines in terms of accuracy, achieving an average improvement of 19.70 points in Pass@1, while reducing generation length by up to 15.55%. Further comprehensive analysis reveals that ThinkRouter can calibrate errors arising from explicit CoT and latent reasoning, and accelerates end-of-thinking token generation by globally lowering model confidence.", "AI": {"tldr": "ThinkRouter\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8def\u7531\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u65f6\u8def\u7531\u5230\u79bb\u6563token\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u65f6\u8def\u7531\u5230\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4e00\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\u9519\u8bef\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u601d\u7ef4\u8f68\u8ff9\u5305\u542b\u8f83\u5c11\u4f4e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u800c\u591a\u4e2a\u4f4e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u601d\u7ef4\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u8f6f\u5d4c\u5165\u4f1a\u5f15\u5165\u548c\u4f20\u64ad\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6", "method": "\u63d0\u51faThinkRouter\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u8def\u7531\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u5f53\u6a21\u578b\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4f4e\u65f6\u8def\u7531\u5230\u79bb\u6563token\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u663e\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u9ad8\u65f6\u8def\u7531\u5230\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u9690\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406", "result": "\u5728STEM\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u7f16\u7801\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cThinkRouter\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u663e\u5f0fCoT\u3001\u968f\u673a\u8def\u7531\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e73\u5747Pass@1\u63d0\u534719.70\u70b9\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u957f\u5ea6\u51cf\u5c11\u8fbe15.55%", "conclusion": "ThinkRouter\u80fd\u591f\u6821\u51c6\u663e\u5f0fCoT\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u5c40\u964d\u4f4e\u6a21\u578b\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u52a0\u901f\u601d\u7ef4\u7ed3\u675ftoken\u7684\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u63a8\u7406"}}

We curated a large single-centre DSA dataset of 99,349 frames and trained a conditional LDM using text embeddings that encoded anatomy and acquisition geometry. To assess clinical realism, four medical experts, including two neuroradiologists, one neurosurgeon, and one internal medicine expert, systematically rated 400 synthetic DSA images using a 5-grade Likert scale for evaluating proximal large, medium, and small peripheral vessels. The generated images achieved image-wise overall Likert scores ranging from 3.1 to 3.3, with high inter-rater reliability (ICC(2,k) = 0.80--0.87).

However, critical meaning errors, such as factual distortions, intent reversals, or biased translations, can undermine the reliability, fairness, and safety of multilingual systems. In this work, we explore the capacity of instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) to detect such critical errors, evaluating models across a range of parameters using the publicly accessible data sets. Our findings show that model scaling and adaptation strategies (zero-shot, few-shot, fine-tuning) yield consistent improvements, outperforming encoder-only baselines like XLM-R and ModernBERT. We argue that improving critical error detection in MT contributes to safer, more trustworthy, and socially accountable information systems by reducing the risk of disinformation, miscommunication, and linguistic harm, especially in high-stakes or underrepresented contexts.

In this work, we propose Sparse Complementary Fusion with reverse KL (SCF-RKL), a novel model merging framework that explicitly controls functional interference through sparse, distribution-aware updates. Instead of assuming linear additivity in parameter space, SCF-RKL measures the functional divergence between models using reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence and selectively incorporates complementary parameters. This mode-seeking, sparsity-inducing design effectively preserves stable representations while integrating new capabilities. We evaluate SCF-RKL across a wide range of model scales and architectures, covering both reasoning-focused and instruction-tuned models.

We introduce LoopFormer, a looped Transformer trained on variable-length trajectories to enable budget-conditioned reasoning. Our core contribution is a shortcut-consistency training scheme that aligns trajectories of different lengths, ensuring that shorter loops yield informative representations while longer loops continue to refine them. LoopFormer conditions each loop on the current time and step size, enabling representations to evolve consistently across trajectories of varying length rather than drifting or stagnating.

Recent approaches using Large Language Models (LLMs) for 3D scene generation show promise but often lack domain-specific reasoning, verification mechanisms, and modular design. These limitations lead to reduced control and poor scalability. This paper investigates the use of LLMs to generate agricultural synthetic simulation environments from natural language prompts, specifically to address the limitations of lacking domain-specific reasoning, verification mechanisms, and modular design. A modular multi-LLM pipeline was developed, integrating 3D asset retrieval, domain knowledge injection, and code generation for the Unreal rendering engine using its API. This results in a 3D environment with realistic planting layouts and environmental context, all based on the input prompt and the domain knowledge. To enhance accuracy and scalability, the system employs a hybrid strategy combining LLM optimization techniques such as few-shot prompting, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), finetuning, and validation. Unlike monolithic models, the modular architecture enables structured data handling, intermediate verification, and flexible expansion. The system was evaluated using structured prompts and semantic accuracy metrics. A user study assessed realism and familiarity against real-world images, while an expert comparison demonstrated significant time savings over manual scene design. The results confirm the effectiveness of multi-LLM pipelines in automating domain-specific 3D scene generation with improved reliability and precision.

However, existing evaluation benchmarks provide minimal coverage of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). To address this gap, we introduce ADRD-Bench, the first ADRD-specific benchmark dataset designed for rigorous evaluation of LLMs. ADRD-Bench has two components: 1) ADRD Unified QA, a synthesis of 1,352 questions consolidated from seven established medical benchmarks, providing a unified assessment of clinical knowledge; and 2) ADRD Caregiving QA, a novel set of 149 questions derived from the Aging Brain Care (ABC) program, a widely used, evidence-based brain health management program. Guided by a program with national expertise in comprehensive ADRD care, this new set was designed to mitigate the lack of practical caregiving context in existing benchmarks. We evaluated 33 state-of-the-art LLMs on the proposed ADRD-Bench. Results showed that the accuracy of open-weight general models ranged from 0.63 to 0.93 (mean: 0.78; std: 0.09). The accuracy of open-weight medical models ranged from 0.48 to 0.93 (mean: 0.82; std: 0.13). The accuracy of closed-source general models ranged from 0.83 to 0.91 (mean: 0.89; std: 0.03). While top-tier models achieved high accuracies (>0.9), case studies revealed that inconsistent reasoning quality and stability limit their reliability, highlighting a critical need for domain-specific improvement to enhance LLMs' knowledge and reasoning grounded in daily caregiving data.

Text-to-Graph-Query-Language (Text-to-GQL) systems act as a translator, converting natural language into executable graph queries. This capability allows Large Language Models (LLMs) to directly analyze and manipulate graph data, posi-tioning them as powerful agent infrastructures for Graph Database Management System (GDBMS). Despite recent progress, existing datasets are often limited in domain coverage, supported graph query languages, or evaluation scope. The advancement of Text-to-GQL systems is hindered by the lack of high-quality benchmark datasets and evaluation methods to systematically compare model capabilities across different graph query languages and domains. In this work, we present Text2GQL-Bench, a unified Text-to-GQL benchmark designed to address these limitations. Text2GQL-Bench couples a multi-GQL dataset that has 178,184 (Question, Query) pairs spanning 13 domains, with a scalable construction framework that generates datasets in different domains, question abstraction levels, and GQLs with heterogeneous resources. To support compre-hensive assessment, we introduce an evaluation method that goes beyond a single end-to-end metric by jointly reporting grammatical validity, similarity, semantic alignment, and execution accuracy. Our evaluation uncovers a stark dialect gap in ISO-GQL generation: even strong LLMs achieve only at most 4% execution accuracy (EX) in zero-shot settings, though a fixed 3-shot prompt raises accuracy to around 50%, the grammatical validity remains lower than 70%. Moreover, a fine-tuned 8B open-weight model reaches 45.1% EX, and 90.8% grammatical validity, demonstrating that most of the performance jump is unlocked by exposure to sufficient ISO-GQL examples.", "AI": {"tldr": "Text2GQL-Bench\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u591a\u9886\u57df\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u67e5\u8be2\u8bed\u8a00\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b178,184\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898-\u67e5\u8be2\u5bf9\uff0c\u8986\u76d613\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5168\u9762\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86ISO-GQL\u751f\u6210\u7684\u663e\u8457\u65b9\u8a00\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u67e5\u8be2\u8bed\u8a00\u7cfb\u7edf\u9762\u4e34\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9886\u57df\u8986\u76d6\u6709\u9650\u3001\u652f\u6301\u7684\u56fe\u67e5\u8be2\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0d\u8db3\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u8303\u56f4\u72ed\u7a84\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u56fe\u67e5\u8be2\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u9886\u57df\u95f4\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faText2GQL-Bench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u591a\u56fe\u67e5\u8be2\u8bed\u8a00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u3001\u95ee\u9898\u62bd\u8c61\u7ea7\u522b\u548c\u56fe\u67e5\u8be2\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u62a5\u544a\u8bed\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3001\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u6267\u884c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u53d1\u73b0ISO-GQL\u751f\u6210\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u65b9\u8a00\u5dee\u8ddd\uff1a\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u5f3aLLM\u6700\u591a\u53ea\u80fd\u8fbe\u52304%\u7684\u6267\u884c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff1b\u56fa\u5b9a3\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u53ef\u5c06\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u81f3\u7ea650%\uff0c\u4f46\u8bed\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4ecd\u4f4e\u4e8e70%\u3002\u5fae\u8c03\u76848B\u5f00\u653e\u6743\u91cd\u6a21\u578b\u8fbe\u523045.1%\u6267\u884c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c90.8%\u8bed\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6765\u81ea\u8db3\u591f\u7684ISO-GQL\u793a\u4f8b\u66b4\u9732\u3002", "conclusion": "Text2GQL-Bench\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u67e5\u8be2\u8bed\u8a00\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56fe\u67e5\u8be2\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662fISO-GQL\u7684\u65b9\u8a00\u5dee\u8ddd\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u57fa\u51c6\u3002"}}

Using ALME, a benchmark of 57,602 controlled audio-text conflict stimuli across 8 languages, we find that Gemini 2.0 Flash exhibits 16.6\\% text dominance under audio-text conflict versus 1.6\\% under text-text conflict with identical reliability cues. This gap is not explained by audio quality: audio-only accuracy (97.2\\%) exceeds cascade accuracy (93.9\\%), indicating audio embeddings preserve more information than text transcripts. We propose that text dominance reflects an asymmetry not in information content but in arbitration accessibility: how easily the model can reason over competing representations.\n  This framework explains otherwise puzzling findings. Forcing transcription before answering increases text dominance (19\\% to 33\\%), sacrificing audio's information advantage without improving accessibility. Framing text as ``deliberately corrupted'' reduces text dominance by 80\\%. A fine-tuning ablation provides interventional evidence: training only the audio projection layer increases text dominance (+26.5\\%), while LoRA on the language model halves it ($-$23.9\\%), localizing text dominance to the LLM's reasoning rather than the audio encoder.

Yet current safety mechanisms for LLM agents focus almost exclusively on preventing failures in advance, providing limited capabilities for responding to, containing, or recovering from incidents after they inevitably arise. In this work, we introduce AIR, the first incident response framework for LLM agent systems. AIR defines a domain-specific language for managing the incident response lifecycle autonomously in LLM agent systems, and integrates it into the agent's execution loop to (1) detect incidents via semantic checks grounded in the current environment state and recent context, (2) guide the agent to execute containment and recovery actions via its tools, and (3) synthesize guardrail rules during eradication to block similar incidents in future executions. We evaluate AIR on three representative agent types. Results show that AIR achieves detection, remediation, and eradication success rates all exceeding 90%. Extensive experiments further confirm the necessity of AIR's key design components, show the timeliness and moderate overhead of AIR, and demonstrate that LLM-generated rules can approach the effectiveness of developer-authored rules across domains.

This issue becomes particularly severe in dense prediction tasks such as spatial-temporal video grounding (STVG). Prior approaches typically focus on enhancing visual-textual alignment or attaching auxiliary decoders. However, these strategies inevitably introduce additional trainable modules, leading to significant annotation costs and computational overhead. In this work, we propose a novel visual prompting paradigm that avoids the difficult problem of aligning coordinates across modalities. Specifically, we reformulate per-frame coordinate prediction as a compact instance-level identification problem by assigning each object a unique, temporally consistent ID. These IDs are embedded into the video as visual prompts, providing explicit and interpretable inputs to the VLMs. Furthermore, we introduce STVG-R1, the first reinforcement learning framework for STVG, which employs a task-driven reward to jointly optimize temporal accuracy, spatial consistency, and structural format regularization. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. STVG-R1 surpasses the baseline Qwen2.5-VL-7B by a remarkable margin of 20.9% on m_IoU on the HCSTVG-v2 benchmark, establishing a new state of the art (SOTA).

We introduce MuRGAt (Multimodal Reasoning with Grounded Attribution), a benchmark for evaluating fact-level multimodal attribution in settings that require reasoning beyond direct observation. Given inputs spanning video, audio, and other modalities, MuRGAt requires models to generate answers with explicit reasoning and precise citations, where each citation specifies both modality and temporal segments. To enable reliable assessment, we introduce an automatic evaluation framework that strongly correlates with human judgments.

However, multi-turn RL remains challenging as rewards are often sparse or delayed, and environments can be stochastic. In this regime, naive trajectory sampling can hinder exploitation and induce mode collapse. We propose TSR (Trajectory-Search Rollouts), a training-time approach that repurposes test-time scaling ideas for improved per-turn rollout generation. TSR performs lightweight tree-style search to construct high-quality trajectories by selecting high-scoring actions at each turn using task-specific feedback. This improves rollout quality and stabilizes learning while leaving the underlying optimization objective unchanged, making TSR optimizer-agnostic. We instantiate TSR with best-of-N, beam, and shallow lookahead search, and pair it with PPO and GRPO, achieving up to 15% performance gains and more stable learning on Sokoban, FrozenLake, and WebShop tasks at a one-time increase in training compute. By moving search from inference time to the rollout stage of training, TSR provides a simple and general mechanism for stronger multi-turn agent learning, complementary to existing frameworks and rejection-sampling-style selection methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "TSR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u8f68\u8ff9\u641c\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6811\u641c\u7d22\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u8f6e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8fbe15%\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347", "motivation": "\u591a\u8f6e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\uff0c\u5956\u52b1\u901a\u5e38\u7a00\u758f\u6216\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u73af\u5883\u5177\u6709\u968f\u673a\u6027\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f1a\u963b\u788d\u63a2\u7d22\u5e76\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u5f0f\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTSR\uff08\u8f68\u8ff9\u641c\u7d22\u5c55\u5f00\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u6280\u672f\uff08\u5982best-of-N\u3001beam search\u548c\u6d45\u5c42\u524d\u77bb\u641c\u7d22\uff09\u91cd\u65b0\u7528\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6811\u641c\u7d22\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u9009\u62e9\u9ad8\u5f97\u5206\u52a8\u4f5c\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8f68\u8ff9", "result": "\u5728Sokoban\u3001FrozenLake\u548cWebShop\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408PPO\u548cGRPO\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe15%\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u548c\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u589e\u52a0\u8bad\u7ec3\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c", "conclusion": "TSR\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u641c\u7d22\u4ece\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u8bad\u7ec3\u5c55\u5f00\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u8f6e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7b80\u5355\u901a\u7528\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u62d2\u7edd\u91c7\u6837\u5f0f\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e92\u8865"}}

Recent decentralized training methods reduce communication overhead by employing federated optimization; however, they still need to train the entire model on each node, remaining constrained by GPU memory limitations. In this work, we propose SParse Expert Synchronization (SPES), a memory-efficient decentralized framework for pretraining mixture-of-experts (MoE) LLMs. SPES trains only a subset of experts per node, substantially lowering the memory footprint. Each node updates its local experts and periodically synchronizes with other nodes, eliminating full-parameter transmission while ensuring efficient knowledge sharing. To accelerate convergence, we introduce an expert-merging warm-up strategy, where experts exchange knowledge early in training, to rapidly establish foundational capabilities. With SPES, we train a 2B-parameter MoE LLM using 16 standalone 48GB GPUs over internet connections, which achieves competitive performance with centrally trained LLMs under similar computational budgets. We further demonstrate scalability by training a 7B model from scratch and a 9B model upcycled from a dense checkpoint, both of which match prior centralized baselines.

However, this binarization step is typically heuristic and can substantially distort estimates of species prevalence and community composition. We present MaxExp, a decision-driven binarization framework that selects the most probable species assemblage by directly maximizing a chosen evaluation metric. MaxExp requires no calibration data and is flexible across several scores. We also introduce the Set Size Expectation (SSE) method, a computationally efficient alternative that predicts assemblages based on expected species richness.

To address these challenges, we propose SIGHT, a framework that enhances search-based reasoning through Self-Evidence Support (SES) and Information-Gain Driven Diverse Branching.

Existing industrial systems typically follow a two-stage paradigm, where candidate texts are first generated and subsequently aligned with online performance metrics such as click-through rate(CTR). This separation often leads to misaligned optimization objectives and low funnel efficiency, limiting global optimality.\n  To address these limitations, we propose RELATE, a reinforcement learning-based end-to-end framework that unifies generation and objective alignment within a single model. Instead of decoupling text generation from downstream metric alignment, RELATE integrates performance and compliance objectives directly into the generation process via policy learning. To better capture ultimate advertiser value beyond click-level signals, We incorporate conversion-oriented metrics into the objective and jointly model them with compliance constraints as multi-dimensional rewards, enabling the model to generate high-quality ad texts that improve conversion performance under policy constraints.\n  Extensive experiments on large-scale industrial datasets demonstrate that RELATE consistently outperforms baselines. Furthermore, online deployment on a production advertising platform yields statistically significant improvements in click-through conversion rate(CTCVR) under strict policy constraints, validating the robustness and real-world effectiveness of the proposed framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "RELATE\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5e7f\u544a\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u5bf9\u9f50\u7edf\u4e00\u5728\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u7ef4\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u4f18\u5316\u8f6c\u5316\u7387\u5e76\u6ee1\u8db3\u5408\u89c4\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4e1a\u7cfb\u7edf\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8303\u5f0f\uff08\u5148\u751f\u6210\u5019\u9009\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u518d\u4e0e\u70b9\u51fb\u7387\u7b49\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u5bf9\u9f50\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u6f0f\u6597\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRELATE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u9f50\u7edf\u4e00\u5728\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u3002\u5c06\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u548c\u5408\u89c4\u7ea6\u675f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u591a\u7ef4\u5956\u52b1\u76f4\u63a5\u6574\u5408\u5230\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u8f6c\u5316\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u6307\u6807\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u70b9\u51fb\u7ea7\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5de5\u4e1a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cRELATE\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e7f\u544a\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u90e8\u7f72\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u653f\u7b56\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u70b9\u51fb\u8f6c\u5316\u7387\u7684\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "RELATE\u901a\u8fc7\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5e7f\u544a\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5206\u79bb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u5408\u89c4\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8f6c\u5316\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u5de5\u4e1a\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Through extensive evaluation, we find that current verifiers frequently fail to detect derivation flaws. Furthermore, we propose a process-aware RLVR training paradigm utilizing verifiers selected via PRIME.

To address this problem, we propose LAVES, a hierarchical LLM-based multi-agent system for generating high-quality instructional videos from educational problems. The LAVES formulates educational video generation as a multi-objective task that simultaneously demands correct step-by-step reasoning, pedagogically coherent narration, semantically faithful visual demonstrations, and precise audio--visual alignment. To address the limitations of prior approaches--including low procedural fidelity, high production cost, and limited controllability--LAVES decomposes the generation workflow into specialized agents coordinated by a central Orchestrating Agent with explicit quality gates and iterative critique mechanisms. Specifically, the Orchestrating Agent supervises a Solution Agent for rigorous problem solving, an Illustration Agent that produces executable visualization codes, and a Narration Agent for learner-oriented instructional scripts. In addition, all outputs from the working agents are subject to semantic critique, rule-based constraints, and tool-based compilation checks. Rather than directly synthesizing pixels, the system constructs a structured executable video script that is deterministically compiled into synchronized visuals and narration using template-driven assembly rules, enabling fully automated end-to-end production without manual editing.

However, extending these capabilities to 4D relighting remains challenging, due primarily to the scarcity of paired 4D relighting training data and the difficulty of maintaining temporal consistency across extreme viewpoints. In this work, we propose Light4D, a novel training-free framework designed to synthesize consistent 4D videos under target illumination, even under extreme viewpoint changes. First, we introduce Disentangled Flow Guidance, a time-aware strategy that effectively injects lighting control into the latent space while preserving geometric integrity. Second, to reinforce temporal consistency, we develop Temporal Consistent Attention within the IC-Light architecture and further incorporate deterministic regularization to eliminate appearance flickering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance in temporal consistency and lighting fidelity, robustly handling camera rotations from -90 to 90.

To solve these limitations, we propose \\textbf{\\model}, a dual-level framework for prefix-protected and difficulty-aware compression under hierarchical supervision. At the sequence level, prefix-protected optimization employs decaying mixed rollouts to maintain valid reasoning paths while promoting conciseness. At the group level, difficulty-aware penalty dynamically scales length constraints based on query complexity, maintaining exploration for harder questions while curbing redundancy on easier ones.

Unlike pretraining methods, which optimize models using token-level probabilities, RLVR fine-tunes models based on reward feedback from self-generated reasoning trajectories, making conventional likelihood-based detection methods less effective. We show that RLVR induces a distinctive behavioral signature: prompts encountered during RLVR training result in more rigid and similar generations, while unseen prompts retain greater diversity. We introduce Min-$k$NN Distance, a simple black-box detector that quantifies this collapse by sampling multiple completions for a given prompt and computing the average of the $k$ smallest nearest-neighbor edit distances. Min-$k$NN Distance requires no access to the reference model or token probabilities. Experiments across multiple RLVR-trained reasoning models show that Min-$k$NN Distance reliably distinguishes RL-seen examples from unseen ones and outperforms existing membership inference and RL contamination detection baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMin-$k$NN Distance\u65b9\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4bRLVR\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6c61\u67d3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\u533a\u5206RL\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u548c\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u63d0\u793a", "motivation": "RLVR\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5956\u52b1\u53cd\u9988\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u4f7f\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f3c\u7136\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u4e14\u672a\u516c\u5f00\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5f15\u53d1\u57fa\u51c6\u6c61\u67d3\u62c5\u5fe7\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMin-$k$NN Distance\u9ed1\u76d2\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff1a\u5bf9\u7ed9\u5b9a\u63d0\u793a\u91c7\u6837\u591a\u4e2a\u8865\u5168\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97k\u4e2a\u6700\u5c0f\u6700\u8fd1\u90bb\u7f16\u8f91\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u503c\uff0c\u91cf\u5316RLVR\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5d29\u6e83\u7279\u5f81", "result": "Min-$k$NN Distance\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u533a\u5206RL\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u548c\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u793a\u4f8b\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2aRLVR\u8bad\u7ec3\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u548cRL\u6c61\u67d3\u68c0\u6d4b\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5", "conclusion": "RLVR\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ea7\u751f\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7279\u5f81\uff0cMin-$k$NN Distance\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u53c2\u8003\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u4ee4\u724c\u6982\u7387\u7684\u6709\u6548\u9ed1\u76d2\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3RL\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6c61\u67d3\u95ee\u9898"}}

However, it remains unclear how specific feedback elements, such as tone and information coverage, contribute to learning outcomes and learner acceptance, particularly across learners with different personality traits. In this study, we define six feedback elements and generate feedback for multiple-choice biology questions using GPT-5. We conduct a learning experiment with 321 first-year high school students and evaluate feedback effectiveness using two learning outcomes measures and subjective evaluations across six criteria. We further analyze differences in how feedback acceptance varies across learners based on Big Five personality traits. Our results show that effective feedback elements share common patterns supporting learning outcomes, while learners' subjective preferences differ across personality-based clusters.

Semantic ID-based approaches effectively discretize this information into compact tokens. However, two challenges persist: (1) Suboptimal Tokenization: existing methods (e.g., RQ-VAE) lack disentanglement between shared cross-modal semantics and modality-specific details, causing redundancy or collapse; (2) Architecture-Data Mismatch: vanilla Transformers treat semantic IDs as flat streams, ignoring the hierarchy of user interactions, items, and tokens. Expanding items into multiple tokens amplifies length and noise, biasing attention toward local details over holistic semantics. We propose Hi-SAM, a Hierarchical Structure-Aware Multi-modal framework with two designs: (1) Disentangled Semantic Tokenizer (DST): unifies modalities via geometry-aware alignment and quantizes them via a coarse-to-fine strategy. Shared codebooks distill consensus while modality-specific ones recover nuances from residuals, enforced by mutual information minimization; (2) Hierarchical Memory-Anchor Transformer (HMAT): splits positional encoding into inter- and intra-item subspaces via Hierarchical RoPE to restore hierarchy.

One such synthetic data generation method is Formula Driven Supervised Learning (FDSL), which can provide an infinite number of perfectly labeled data through a formula driven approach, such as fractals or contours. FDSL does not have common drawbacks like manual labor, privacy and other ethical concerns. In this work we generate 3D fractals using 3D Iterated Function Systems (IFS) for pre-training an action recognition model. The fractals are temporally transformed to form a video that is used as a pre-training dataset for downstream task of action recognition. We find that standard methods of generating fractals are slow and produce degenerate 3D fractals. Therefore, we systematically explore alternative ways of generating fractals and finds that overly-restrictive approaches, while generating aesthetically pleasing fractals, are detrimental for downstream task performance. We propose a novel method, Targeted Smart Filtering, to address both the generation speed and fractal diversity issue. The method reports roughly 100 times faster sampling speed and achieves superior downstream performance against other 3D fractal filtering methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faTargeted Smart Filtering\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc73D\u8fed\u4ee3\u51fd\u6570\u7cfb\u7edf\u751f\u6210\u5206\u5f62\u89c6\u9891\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u5206\u5f62\u751f\u6210\u901f\u5ea6\u6162\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898", "motivation": "\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u516c\u5f0f\u9a71\u52a8\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60(FDSL)\u901a\u8fc7\u516c\u5f0f\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u65e0\u9650\u5b8c\u7f8e\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u3002\u4f20\u7edf3D\u5206\u5f62\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u901f\u5ea6\u6162\u4e14\u4ea7\u751f\u9000\u5316\u5206\u5f62\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd", "method": "\u4f7f\u75283D\u8fed\u4ee3\u51fd\u6570\u7cfb\u7edf\u751f\u6210\u5206\u5f62\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u6362\u5f62\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002\u63d0\u51faTargeted Smart Filtering\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u751f\u6210\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u5206\u5f62\u591a\u6837\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u8fc7\u6ee4\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ea6100\u500d\u52a0\u901f", "result": "Targeted Smart Filtering\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ea6100\u500d\u91c7\u6837\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed63D\u5206\u5f62\u8fc7\u6ee4\u65b9\u6cd5", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684Targeted Smart Filtering\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e863D\u5206\u5f62\u751f\u6210\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6848"}}

Unlike natural image fields, meteorological fields lack task-agnostic foundation models and explicit semantic structures, making VFM-based regularization inapplicable. Moreover, existing frequency-based approaches impose identical spectral regularization across channels under a homogeneity assumption, which leads to uneven regularization strength under the inter-variable spectral heterogeneity in multivariate meteorological data. To address these challenges, we propose a 3D Masked AutoEncoder (3D-MAE) that encodes weather-state evolution features as an additional conditioning for the diffusion model, together with a Variable-Aware Masked Frequency Modeling (VA-MFM) strategy that adaptively selects thresholds based on the spectral energy distribution of each variable. Together, we propose PuYun-LDM, which enhances latent diffusability and achieves superior performance to ENS at short lead times while remaining comparable to ENS at longer horizons. PuYun-LDM generates a 15-day global forecast with a 6-hour temporal resolution in five minutes on a single NVIDIA H200 GPU, while ensemble forecasts can be efficiently produced in parallel.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faPuYun-LDM\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc73D-MAE\u7f16\u7801\u5929\u6c14\u72b6\u6001\u6f14\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408VA-MFM\u7b56\u7565\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9009\u62e9\u5404\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u9891\u8c31\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u96c6\u5408\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\u4e2d\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6269\u6563\u80fd\u529b\u9650\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff08\u22640.25\u00b0\uff09\u96c6\u5408\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u6269\u6563\u80fd\u529b\u9650\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u6c14\u8c61\u573a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4efb\u52a1\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u660e\u786e\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u57fa\u4e8eVFM\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u9891\u7387\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u540c\u8d28\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u901a\u9053\u65bd\u52a0\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u9891\u8c31\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u6c14\u8c61\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9891\u8c31\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u4e0b\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPuYun-LDM\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u4f7f\u75283D\u63a9\u7801\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff083D-MAE\uff09\u7f16\u7801\u5929\u6c14\u72b6\u6001\u6f14\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u989d\u5916\u6761\u4ef6\uff1b2\uff09\u63d0\u51fa\u53d8\u91cf\u611f\u77e5\u63a9\u7801\u9891\u7387\u5efa\u6a21\uff08VA-MFM\uff09\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u6bcf\u4e2a\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u9891\u8c31\u80fd\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9009\u62e9\u9608\u503c\uff1b3\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u6280\u672f\u589e\u5f3a\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "PuYun-LDM\u5728\u77ed\u9884\u62a5\u65f6\u6548\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8eENS\u96c6\u5408\u9884\u62a5\uff0c\u5728\u957f\u9884\u62a5\u65f6\u6548\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u6bd4\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5355\u4e2aNVIDIA H200 GPU\u4e0a5\u5206\u949f\u5185\u751f\u621015\u5929\u5168\u7403\u9884\u62a5\uff086\u5c0f\u65f6\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u5e76\u884c\u751f\u6210\u96c6\u5408\u9884\u62a5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc73D-MAE\u548cVA-MFM\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u96c6\u5408\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\u4e2d\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6269\u6563\u80fd\u529b\u9650\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4e3a\u6c14\u8c61\u9884\u62a5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, current VLAs still suffer from low sample efficiency and limited generalization. This paper argues that these limitations are closely tied to an overlooked component, pretrained visual representation, which offers insufficient knowledge on both aspects of environment understanding and policy prior. Through an in-depth analysis, we find that commonly used visual representations in VLAs, whether pretrained via language-image contrastive learning or image-based self-supervised learning, remain inadequate at capturing crucial, task-relevant environment information and at inducing effective policy priors, i.e., anticipatory knowledge of how the environment evolves under successful task execution. In contrast, we discover that predictive embeddings pretrained on videos, in particular V-JEPA 2, are adept at flexibly discarding unpredictable environment factors and encoding task-relevant temporal dynamics, thereby effectively compensating for key shortcomings of existing visual representations in VLAs. Building on these observations, we introduce JEPA-VLA, a simple yet effective approach that adaptively integrates predictive embeddings into existing VLAs.

Existing methods rely on auxiliary models for static length prediction, but they incur high overhead, generalize poorly, and fail in stochastic \"one-to-many\" sampling scenarios. We introduce a lightweight framework that reuses the main model's internal hidden states for efficient length prediction. Our framework features two core components: 1) Entropy-Guided Token Pooling (EGTP), which uses on-the-fly activations and token entropy for highly accurate static prediction with negligible cost, and 2) Progressive Length Prediction (PLP), which dynamically estimates the remaining length at each decoding step to handle stochastic generation. To validate our approach, we build and release ForeLen, a comprehensive benchmark with long-sequence, Chain-of-Thought, and RL data.

The prevailing works attempt to construct efficient motion representations, but lack a unified spatiotemporal decomposition framework, suffering from either holistic temporal optimization or coupled hierarchical spatial composition. To this end, we propose WorldTree, a unified framework comprising Temporal Partition Tree (TPT) that enables coarse-to-fine optimization based on the inheritance-based partition tree structure for hierarchical temporal decomposition, and Spatial Ancestral Chains (SAC) that recursively query ancestral hierarchical structure to provide complementary spatial dynamics while specializing motion representations across ancestral nodes. Experimental results on different datasets indicate that our proposed method achieves 8.26% improvement of LPIPS on NVIDIA-LS and 9.09% improvement of mLPIPS on DyCheck compared to the second-best method.

However, a precision paradox persists in complex reasoning tasks: optical perception systems transcribe symbols without capturing logical topology, while pixel-based generative models produce visual artifacts lacking mathematical exactness. To bridge this gap, we propose that reasoning over visual inputs be reconceptualized as optical decompression-the process of reconstructing latent logical structures from compressed visual tokens. Guided by the axiom that Parsing is Reasoning, we introduce Thinking with Drafting (TwD), which utilizes a minimalist Domain-Specific Language (DSL) as a grounding intermediate representation. Unlike standard approaches that hallucinate answers directly, TwD forces the model to draft its mental model into executable code, rendering deterministic visual proofs for self-verification.

Furthermore, while autoregressive LMs can output explicit reasoning, their true reasoning process is opaque, which introduces risks like deception and hallucination. In this work, we introduce the Prototype Transformer (ProtoT) -- an autoregressive LM architecture based on prototypes (parameter vectors), posed as an alternative to the standard self-attention-based transformers. ProtoT works by means of two-way communication between the input sequence and the prototypes, and we show that this leads to the prototypes automatically capturing nameable concepts (e.g. \"woman\") during training. They provide the potential to interpret the model's reasoning and allow for targeted edits of its behavior. Furthermore, by design, the prototypes create communication channels that aggregate contextual information at different time scales, aiding interpretability. In terms of computation scalability, ProtoT scales linearly with sequence length vs the quadratic scalability of SOTA self-attention transformers. Compared to baselines, ProtoT scales well with model and data size, and performs well on text generation and downstream tasks (GLUE). ProtoT exhibits robustness to input perturbations on par or better than some baselines, but differs from them by providing interpretable pathways showing how robustness and sensitivity arises. Reaching close to the performance of state-of-the-art architectures, ProtoT paves the way to creating well-performing autoregressive LMs interpretable by design.", "AI": {"tldr": "ProtoT\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u539f\u578b\u5411\u91cf\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u66ff\u4ee3\u6807\u51c6\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529bTransformer\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f93\u5165\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0e\u539f\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u901a\u4fe1\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7ebf\u6027\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u9886\u57df\u8d85\u8d8a\u4eba\u7c7b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\uff0c\u524a\u5f31\u4e86\u5bf9\u5176\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u3002\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u8f93\u51fa\u663e\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u771f\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u662f\u9ed1\u7bb1\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u6b3a\u9a97\u548c\u5e7b\u89c9\u7b49\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u539f\u578bTransformer\uff08ProtoT\uff09\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u539f\u578b\uff08\u53c2\u6570\u5411\u91cf\uff09\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8f93\u5165\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0e\u539f\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u4f7f\u539f\u578b\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u81ea\u52a8\u6355\u83b7\u53ef\u547d\u540d\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff08\u5982\"\u5973\u6027\"\uff09\u3002\u539f\u578b\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u805a\u5408\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u901a\u9053\u3002", "result": "ProtoT\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ebf\u6027\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff08vs \u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529bTransformer\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff09\u3002\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0a\u6269\u5c55\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u5728\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\uff08GLUE\uff09\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u5c55\u793a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u654f\u611f\u6027\u7684\u6765\u6e90\u3002", "conclusion": "ProtoT\u5728\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u67b6\u6784\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4e3a\u521b\u5efa\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u94fa\u5e73\u4e86\u9053\u8def\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u539f\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5141\u8bb8\u5bf9\u5176\u884c\u4e3a\u8fdb\u884c\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u3002"}}

While existing sparse and linear attention mechanisms attempt to mitigate these issues, they typically involve a trade-off between memory efficiency and model performance. This paper introduces MiniCPM-SALA, a 9B-parameter hybrid architecture that integrates the high-fidelity long-context modeling of sparse attention (InfLLM-V2) with the global efficiency of linear attention (Lightning Attention). By employing a layer selection algorithm to integrate these mechanisms in a 1:3 ratio and utilizing a hybrid positional encoding (HyPE), the model maintains efficiency and performance for long-context tasks. Furthermore, we introduce a cost-effective continual training framework that transforms pre-trained Transformer-based models into hybrid models, which reduces training costs by approximately 75% compared to training from scratch. Extensive experiments show that MiniCPM-SALA maintains general capabilities comparable to full-attention models while offering improved efficiency. On a single NVIDIA A6000D GPU, the model achieves up to 3.5x the inference speed of the full-attention model at the sequence length of 256K tokens and supports context lengths of up to 1M tokens, a scale where traditional full-attention 8B models fail because of memory constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "MiniCPM-SALA\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a9B\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u901a\u8fc71:3\u7684\u5c42\u9009\u62e9\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u5728\u5355GPU\u4e0a\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u8fbe1M tokens\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5168\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u53473.5\u500d\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5411\u8d85\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5e94\u7528\u53d1\u5c55\u65f6\u9762\u4e34Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u6210\u672c\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u548c\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u901a\u5e38\u5728\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u53c8\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMiniCPM-SALA\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u96c6\u6210InfLLM-V2\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5efa\u6a21\u548cLightning Attention\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u6548\u7387\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u5c42\u9009\u62e9\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ee51:3\u6bd4\u4f8b\u6574\u5408\u4e24\u79cd\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801(HyPE)\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u7ecf\u6d4e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4ece\u5934\u8bad\u7ec3\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea675%\u6210\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5355\u5757NVIDIA A6000D GPU\u4e0a\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5728256K tokens\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0b\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u8fbe\u5230\u5168\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u76843.5\u500d\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u8fbe1M tokens\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\uff08\u4f20\u7edf8B\u5168\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u56e0\u5185\u5b58\u9650\u5236\u65e0\u6cd5\u8fbe\u5230\uff09\u3002\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u5168\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u4e00\u822c\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "MiniCPM-SALA\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587LLM\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u7387-\u6027\u80fd\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u5229\u7528\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u8d85\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Under review", "summary": "Dynamic maps (DM) serve as the fundamental information infrastructure for vehicle-road-cloud (VRC) cooperative autonomous driving in China and Japan. By providing comprehensive traffic scene representations, DM overcome the limitations of standalone autonomous driving systems (ADS), such as physical occlusions. Although DM-enhanced ADS have been successfully deployed in real-world applications in Japan, existing DM systems still lack a natural-language-supported (NLS) human interface, which could substantially enhance human-DM interaction. To address this gap, this paper introduces VRCsim, a VRC cooperative perception (CP) simulation framework designed to generate streaming VRC-CP data. Based on VRCsim, we construct a question-answering data set, VRC-QA, focused on spatial querying and reasoning in mixed-traffic scenes. Building upon VRCsim and VRC-QA, we further propose Talk2DM, a plug-and-play module that extends VRC-DM systems with NLS querying and commonsense reasoning capabilities. Talk2DM is built upon a novel chain-of-prompt (CoP) mechanism that progressively integrates human-defined rules with the commonsense knowledge of large language models (LLMs). Experiments on VRC-QA show that Talk2DM can seamlessly switch across different LLMs while maintaining high NLS query accuracy, demonstrating strong generalization capability. Although larger models tend to achieve higher accuracy, they incur significant efficiency degradation. Our results reveal that Talk2DM, powered by Qwen3:8B, Gemma3:27B, and GPT-oss models, achieves over 93\\% NLS query accuracy with an average response time of only 2-5 seconds, indicating strong practical potential.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Talk2DM\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u5730\u56fe\u589e\u52a0\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u67e5\u8be2\u548c\u5e38\u8bc6\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7VRCsim\u4eff\u771f\u6846\u67b6\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6784\u5efaVRC-QA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u94fe\u5f0f\u63d0\u793a\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u67e5\u8be2\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u52a8\u6001\u5730\u56fe\u7cfb\u7edf\u7f3a\u4e4f\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u652f\u6301\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u754c\u9762\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u6548\u7387\u3002\u867d\u7136DM\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5df2\u5728\u65e5\u672c\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u5c11\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a5\u53e3\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u5730\u56fe\u7684\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faVRCsim\u4eff\u771f\u6846\u67b6\u751f\u6210\u8f66\u8def\u4e91\u534f\u540c\u611f\u77e5\u6570\u636e\u6d41\uff0c\u6784\u5efaVRC-QA\u7a7a\u95f4\u67e5\u8be2\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1Talk2DM\u63d2\u4ef6\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u94fe\u5f0f\u63d0\u793a\u673a\u5236\u7ed3\u5408\u4eba\u5de5\u89c4\u5219\u4e0eLLM\u5e38\u8bc6\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "result": "Talk2DM\u5728\u4e0d\u540cLLM\u95f4\u65e0\u7f1d\u5207\u6362\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u67e5\u8be2\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff08\u8d85\u8fc793%\uff09\uff0cQwen3:8B\u3001Gemma3:27B\u548cGPT-oss\u6a21\u578b\u5e73\u5747\u54cd\u5e94\u65f6\u95f4\u4ec52-5\u79d2\uff0c\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u66f4\u9ad8\u4f46\u6548\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u660e\u663e\u3002", "conclusion": "Talk2DM\u6210\u529f\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u5730\u56fe\u7cfb\u7edf\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u67e5\u8be2\u548c\u5e38\u8bc6\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u67e5\u8be2\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u54cd\u5e94\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Recent multi-view diffusion models improve 3D-aware street view generation, but they struggle to produce place-aware and background-consistent urban scenes from text, BEV maps, and object bounding boxes. This limits their effectiveness in generating realistic samples for place recognition tasks. To address these challenges, we propose DiffPlace, a novel framework that introduces a place-ID controller to enable place-controllable multi-view image generation. The place-ID controller employs linear projection, perceiver transformer, and contrastive learning to map place-ID embeddings into a fixed CLIP space, allowing the model to synthesize images with consistent background buildings while flexibly modifying foreground objects and weather conditions. Extensive experiments, including quantitative comparisons and augmented training evaluations, demonstrate that DiffPlace outperforms existing methods in both generation quality and training support for visual place recognition.

The method trains subword embeddings on raw text and groups related forms through combined cosine and n-gram similarity. This allows spelling and morphological diversity to be examined and analysed as linguistic structure rather than treated as noise. Using a large corpus of Luxembourgish user comments, the approach uncovers extensive lexical and orthographic variation that aligns with patterns described in dialectal and sociolinguistic research.

Extracting this signal typically relies on metrics such as perplexity, which do not adequately account for context; how one should interpret a given next-token probability is dependent on the number of reasonable choices encoded by the shape of the conditional distribution. In this work, we present DMAP, a mathematically grounded method that maps a text, via a language model, to a set of samples in the unit interval that jointly encode rank and probability information. This representation enables efficient, model-agnostic analysis and supports a range of applications. We illustrate its utility through three case studies: (i) validation of generation parameters to ensure data integrity, (ii) examining the role of probability curvature in machine-generated text detection, and (iii) a forensic analysis revealing statistical fingerprints left in downstream models that have been subject to post-training on synthetic data.

However, broad evidence suggests that LLMs capture the intrinsic structure of natural language, where the phenomenon of \"feature splitting\" in particular indicates that such structure is hierarchical. To capture this, we propose the Hierarchical Sparse Autoencoder (HSAE), which jointly learns a series of SAEs and the parent-child relationships between their features. HSAE strengthens the alignment between parent and child features through two novel mechanisms: a structural constraint loss and a random feature perturbation mechanism. Extensive experiments across various LLMs and layers demonstrate that HSAE consistently recovers semantically meaningful hierarchies, supported by both qualitative case studies and rigorous quantitative metrics. At the same time, HSAE preserves the reconstruction fidelity and interpretability of standard SAEs across different dictionary sizes.

We also provide a simple observe-before-act baseline (ObAct) that integrates short-term observations with the current frame via spatiotemporal attention to predict actions, achieving an 8.1% improvement in location success rate.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDynaHOI-Gym\u5e73\u53f0\u548cDynaHOI-10M\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u52a8\u6001\u624b-\u7269\u4ea4\u4e92\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86ObAct\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u624b\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u9759\u6001\u7269\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\uff08\u79fb\u52a8\u76ee\u6807\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u5173\u952e\u534f\u8c03\uff09\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u5e73\u53f0\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6765\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d", "method": "1) \u6784\u5efaDynaHOI-Gym\u7edf\u4e00\u5728\u7ebf\u95ed\u73af\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u8fd0\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u5668\u548c\u57fa\u4e8erollout\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff1b2) \u521b\u5efaDynaHOI-10M\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff081000\u4e07\u5e27\uff0c18\u4e07\u6761\u624b\u90e8\u6355\u6349\u8f68\u8ff9\uff09\uff1b3) \u63d0\u51faObAct\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u7a7a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6574\u5408\u77ed\u671f\u89c2\u5bdf\u4e0e\u5f53\u524d\u5e27\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u52a8\u4f5c", "result": "1) \u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u624b-\u7269\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e73\u53f0\u548c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b2) ObAct\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e868.1%\u7684\u63d0\u5347\uff1b3) \u76ee\u6807\u8fd0\u52a8\u88ab\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4e3a8\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u7c7b\u522b\u548c22\u4e2a\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5b50\u7c7b\u522b", "conclusion": "DynaHOI-Gym\u5e73\u53f0\u548cDynaHOI-10M\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u624b-\u7269\u4ea4\u4e92\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0cObAct\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u89c2\u5bdf-\u884c\u52a8\u6574\u5408\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u52a8\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840"}}

Selective Abstraction for Reliable Long-Form Text Generation", "comment": null, "summary": "LLMs are widely used, yet they remain prone to factual errors that erode user trust and limit adoption in high-risk settings. One approach to mitigate this risk is to equip models with uncertainty estimation mechanisms that abstain when confidence is low. However, this binary \"all-or-nothing\" approach is excessively restrictive in long-form settings, often discarding valuable information. We introduce Selective Abstraction (SA), a framework that enables LLMs to trade specificity for reliability by selectively reducing the detail of uncertain content. We first formalize SA through the lenses of selective risk and coverage. We then propose Atom-wise Selective Abstraction, a claim-level instantiation that decomposes responses into atomic claims (short, self-contained statements each expressing a single fact) and replaces uncertain atoms with higher confidence, less specific abstractions. To evaluate this framework, we develop a novel end-to-end pipeline for open-ended generation that instantiates risk as factual correctness and measures coverage using an information-theoretic measure of retained information. Across six open-source models on the FactScore and LongFact-Objects benchmarks, atom-wise SA consistently outperforms existing baselines, improving the area under the risk-coverage curve (AURC) by up to 27.73% over claim removal, demonstrating that reducing specificity can boost accuracy and reliability while preserving most of their original meaning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u62bd\u8c61(SA)\u6846\u67b6\u8ba9LLM\u901a\u8fc7\u964d\u4f4e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\u6765\u6743\u8861\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u539f\u5b50\u7ea7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u62bd\u8c61\u5c06\u56de\u7b54\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u539f\u5b50\u58f0\u660e\uff0c\u7528\u66f4\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u62bd\u8c61\u66ff\u6362\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u539f\u5b50\uff0c\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u5347\u98ce\u9669-\u8986\u76d6\u66f2\u7ebf\u4e0b\u9762\u79ef\u8fbe27.73%\u3002", "motivation": "LLM\u5b58\u5728\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6027\u9519\u8bef\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u7528\u6237\u4fe1\u4efb\u5e76\u9650\u5236\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u573a\u666f\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u673a\u5236\u91c7\u7528\u4e8c\u5143\"\u5168\u6709\u6216\u5168\u65e0\"\u7684\u5f03\u6743\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u957f\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u8fc7\u4e8e\u4e25\u683c\uff0c\u4f1a\u4e22\u5f03\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u62bd\u8c61(SA)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u4e0e\u8986\u76d6\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5b9a\u4e49\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u5b9e\u73b0\u539f\u5b50\u7ea7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u62bd\u8c61\uff1a\u5c06\u56de\u7b54\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u539f\u5b50\u58f0\u660e\uff08\u8868\u8fbe\u5355\u4e00\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7684\u7b80\u77ed\u81ea\u5305\u542b\u8bed\u53e5\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u66f4\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4f46\u66f4\u4e0d\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u62bd\u8c61\u66ff\u6362\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u539f\u5b50\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bc4\u4f30\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5c06\u98ce\u9669\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u65b9\u6cd5\u6d4b\u91cf\u4fdd\u7559\u4fe1\u606f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8986\u76d6\u3002", "result": "\u5728FactScore\u548cLongFact-Objects\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u516d\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0c\u539f\u5b50\u7ea7SA\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u58f0\u660e\u79fb\u9664\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u98ce\u9669-\u8986\u76d6\u66f2\u7ebf\u4e0b\u9762\u79ef(AURC)\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe27.73%\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u964d\u4f4e\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u539f\u59cb\u542b\u4e49\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u62bd\u8c61\u6846\u67b6\u4e3aLLM\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6743\u8861\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u964d\u4f4e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\u800c\u975e\u5b8c\u5168\u5f03\u6743\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4fe1\u606f\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684LLM\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We propose a novel framework that synthesises both LGE images and their corresponding segmentation masks using implicit neural representations (INRs) combined with denoising diffusion models. Our approach first trains INRs to capture continuous spatial representations of LGE data and associated myocardium and fibrosis masks. These INRs are then compressed into compact latent embeddings, preserving essential anatomical information. A diffusion model operates on this latent space to generate new representations, which are decoded into synthetic LGE images with anatomically consistent segmentation masks. Experiments on 133 cardiac MRI scans suggest that augmenting training data with 200 synthetic volumes contributes to improved fibrosis segmentation performance, with the Dice score showing an increase from 0.509 to 0.524.

Existing automated methods primarily follow two paradigms: Decoupled Factor Generation, which treats factor discovery as isolated events, and Iterative Factor Evolution, which focuses on local parent-child refinements. However, both paradigms lack a global structural view, often treating factor pools as unstructured collections or fragmented chains, which leads to redundant search and limited diversity. To address these limitations, we introduce AlphaPROBE (Alpha Mining via Principled Retrieval and On-graph Biased Evolution), a framework that reframes alpha mining as the strategic navigation of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). By modeling factors as nodes and evolutionary links as edges, AlphaPROBE treats the factor pool as a dynamic, interconnected ecosystem. The framework consists of two core components: a Bayesian Factor Retriever that identifies high-potential seeds by balancing exploitation and exploration through a posterior probability model, and a DAG-aware Factor Generator that leverages the full ancestral trace of factors to produce context-aware, nonredundant optimizations. Extensive experiments on three major Chinese stock market datasets against 8 competitive baselines demonstrate that AlphaPROBE significantly gains enhanced performance in predictive accuracy, return stability and training efficiency. Our results confirm that leveraging global evolutionary topology is essential for efficient and robust automated alpha discovery.

Existing benchmarks often emphasize English or Chinese and can over-penalize benign formatting and linearization choices (e.g., line breaks, list segmentation, alternative table renderings) that are largely irrelevant for downstream use.\n  We introduce a French-focused benchmark of difficult pages selected via model-disagreement sampling from a corpus of 60{,}000 documents, covering handwritten forms, complex layouts, dense tables, and graphics-rich pages. Evaluation is performed with unit-test-style checks that target concrete failure modes (text presence, reading order, and local table constraints) combined with category-specific normalization designed to discount presentation-only variance.

Yet our analyses reveal that apparent convergence in benchmark accuracy can conceal deep epistemic divergence. Using two major reasoning benchmarks - MMLU-Pro and GPQA - we show that LLMs achieving comparable accuracy still disagree on 16-66% of items, and 16-38% among top-performing frontier models. These discrepancies suggest distinct error profiles for different LLMs. When such models are used for scientific data annotation and inference, their hidden disagreements propagate into research results: in re-analyses of published studies in education and political science, switching the annotation model can change estimated treatment effects by more than 80%, and in some cases reverses their sign. Together, these findings illustrate a benchmark illusion, where equal accuracy may conceal disagreement, with model choice becoming a hidden yet consequential variable for scientific reproducibility.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8d8b\u540c\u7684\u8868\u8c61\u4e0b\u5b58\u5728\u6df1\u5c42\u8ba4\u77e5\u5206\u6b67\uff0c\u4e0d\u540cLLM\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0b\u4ecd\u670916-66%\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u5206\u6b67\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u9690\u85cf\u5206\u6b67\u4f1a\u4f20\u64ad\u5230\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u63ed\u793a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8d8b\u540c\u7684\u8868\u8c61\u53ef\u80fd\u63a9\u76d6\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u6df1\u5c42\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u5206\u6b67\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7a76\u8fd9\u79cd\u9690\u85cf\u5206\u6b67\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u7ed3\u679c\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528MMLU-Pro\u548cGPQA\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540cLLM\u5728\u8fbe\u5230\u53ef\u6bd4\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u65f6\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u5206\u6b67\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u6790\u6559\u80b2\u548c\u653f\u6cbb\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5df2\u53d1\u8868\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5207\u6362\u6807\u6ce8\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6cbb\u7597\u6548\u679c\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "LLM\u5728\u53ef\u6bd4\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0b\u4ecd\u670916-66%\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u5206\u6b67\uff0c\u524d\u6cbf\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u670916-38%\u7684\u5206\u6b67\uff1b\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u5207\u6362\u6807\u6ce8\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4f7f\u6cbb\u7597\u6548\u679c\u4f30\u8ba1\u53d8\u5316\u8d85\u8fc780%\uff0c\u6709\u65f6\u751a\u81f3\u53cd\u8f6c\u7b26\u53f7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5b58\u5728\"\u57fa\u51c6\u5e7b\u89c9\"\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5373\u76f8\u7b49\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u53ef\u80fd\u63a9\u76d6\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u7684\u6df1\u5c42\u5206\u6b67\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u6210\u4e3a\u5f71\u54cd\u79d1\u5b66\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u4f46\u5173\u952e\u53d8\u91cf\u3002"}}

However, current LLM-based methods primarily follow either an Asset-Centric paradigm focused on individual stock prediction or a Market-Centric approach for portfolio allocation, often remaining agnostic to the underlying reasoning that drives market movements. In this paper, we propose a Logic-Oriented perspective, modeling the financial market as a dynamic, evolutionary ecosystem of competing investment narratives, termed Modes of Thought. To operationalize this view, we introduce MEME (Modeling the Evolutionary Modes of Financial Markets), designed to reconstruct market dynamics through the lens of evolving logics. MEME employs a multi-agent extraction module to transform noisy data into high-fidelity Investment Arguments and utilizes Gaussian Mixture Modeling to uncover latent consensus within a semantic space. To model semantic drift among different market conditions, we also implement a temporal evaluation and alignment mechanism to track the lifecycle and historical profitability of these modes. By prioritizing enduring market wisdom over transient anomalies, MEME ensures that portfolio construction is guided by robust reasoning. Extensive experiments on three heterogeneous Chinese stock pools from 2023 to 2025 demonstrate that MEME consistently outperforms seven SOTA baselines. Further ablation studies, sensitivity analysis, lifecycle case study and cost analysis validate MEME's capacity to identify and adapt to the evolving consensus of financial markets.

Although deep learning models have demonstrated significant accuracy, they frequently suffer from miscalibration, manifested as overconfidence in erroneous predictions. To facilitate clinical acceptance, it is imperative that models quantify uncertainty in a manner that correlates with prediction correctness, allowing clinicians to identify unreliable outputs for further review. In order to address this necessity, the present paper proposes a generalizable probabilistic optimization framework grounded in Bayesian deep learning. Specifically, a novel Confidence-Uncertainty Boundary Loss (CUB-Loss) is introduced that imposes penalties on high-certainty errors and low-certainty correct predictions, explicitly enforcing alignment between prediction correctness and uncertainty estimates. Complementing this training-time optimization, a Dual Temperature Scaling (DTS) strategy is devised for post-hoc calibration, further refining the posterior distribution to improve intuitive explainability. The proposed framework is validated on three distinct medical imaging tasks: automatic screening of pneumonia, diabetic retinopathy detection, and identification of skin lesions. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves consistent calibration improvements across diverse modalities, maintains robust performance in data-scarce scenarios, and remains effective on severely imbalanced datasets, underscoring its potential for real clinical deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6982\u7387\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6-\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8fb9\u754c\u635f\u5931\u548c\u53cc\u6e29\u5ea6\u7f29\u653e\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u533b\u7597\u5f71\u50cfAI\u6a21\u578b\u6821\u51c6\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u80ba\u708e\u7b5b\u67e5\u3001\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u75c5\u53d8\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u76ae\u80a4\u75c5\u53d8\u8bc6\u522b\u4e09\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u533b\u7597\u5f71\u50cfAI\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u5176\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u540c\u7b49\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u5e38\u5b58\u5728\u6821\u51c6\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u5bf9\u9519\u8bef\u9884\u6d4b\u8fc7\u5ea6\u81ea\u4fe1\u3002\u4e3a\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e34\u5e8a\u63a5\u53d7\u5ea6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u4ee5\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u91cf\u5316\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u80fd\u591f\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u8f93\u51fa\u4ee5\u4f9b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5ba1\u67e5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u7528\u6982\u7387\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u5f15\u5165\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6-\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8fb9\u754c\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5bf9\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u9519\u8bef\u548c\u4f4e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6b63\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u65bd\u52a0\u60e9\u7f5a\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u5f3a\u5236\u9884\u6d4b\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b2) \u8bbe\u8ba1\u53cc\u6e29\u5ea6\u7f29\u653e\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u540e\u5904\u7406\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7ec6\u5316\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u76f4\u89c2\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u80ba\u708e\u81ea\u52a8\u7b5b\u67e5\u3001\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u75c5\u53d8\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u76ae\u80a4\u75c5\u53d8\u8bc6\u522b\u4e09\u4e2a\u533b\u7597\u5f71\u50cf\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff1a1) \u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u6001\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u6539\u8fdb\uff1b2) \u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u80fd\uff1b3) \u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u6709\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u533b\u7597\u5f71\u50cfAI\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u6311\u6218\u6027\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u4e34\u5e8a\u90e8\u7f72\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

This setting raises a central question: how can an agent dynamically select an LLM that is sufficiently capable for the current generation step while remaining computationally efficient? While model cascades offer a practical mechanism for balancing this trade-off, existing routing strategies typically rely on static heuristics or external controllers and do not explicitly account for model uncertainty. We introduce AdaptEvolve: Adaptive LLM Selection for Multi-LLM Evolutionary Refinement within an evolutionary sequential refinement framework that leverages intrinsic generation confidence to estimate real-time solvability.

Unlike prior static or synchronous evaluations, Gaia2 introduces scenarios where environments evolve independently of agent actions, requiring agents to operate under temporal constraints, adapt to noisy and dynamic events, resolve ambiguity, and collaborate with other agents. Each scenario is paired with a write-action verifier, enabling fine-grained, action-level evaluation and making Gaia2 directly usable for reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source models shows that no model dominates across capabilities: GPT-5 (high) reaches the strongest overall score of 42% pass@1 but fails on time-sensitive tasks, Claude-4 Sonnet trades accuracy and speed for cost, Kimi-K2 leads among open-source models with 21% pass@1. These results highlight fundamental trade-offs between reasoning, efficiency, robustness, and expose challenges in closing the \"sim2real\" gap. Gaia2 is built on a consumer environment with the open-source Agents Research Environments platform and designed to be easy to extend.

Existing approaches resort to Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to enhance this capability. However, they either incur high computational costs through joint training or suffer from spatial information loss when relying solely on textual prompts. To alleviate these limitations, we propose a Spatial Chain-of-Thought (SCoT) framework, a plug-and-play approach that effectively bridges the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs with the generative power of diffusion models. Specifically, we first enhance the diffusion model's layout awareness by training it on an interleaved text-coordinate instruction format. We then leverage state-of-the-art MLLMs as planners to generate comprehensive layout plans, transferring their spatial planning capabilities directly to the generation process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on image generation benchmarks and significantly outperforms baselines on complex reasoning tasks, while also showing strong efficacy in image editing scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7a7a\u95f4\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\uff08SCoT\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7406\u89e3\u6587\u672c-\u5750\u6807\u6307\u4ee4\u683c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528MLLMs\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u751f\u6210\u5e03\u5c40\u8ba1\u5212\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7f8e\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7a7a\u95f4\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e26\u6765\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u5bfc\u81f4\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7a7a\u95f4\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\uff08SCoT\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u672c-\u5750\u6807\u4ea4\u9519\u6307\u4ee4\u683c\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u589e\u5f3a\u5e03\u5c40\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff1b2\uff09\u5229\u7528\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u751f\u6210\u5168\u9762\u7684\u5e03\u5c40\u8ba1\u5212\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u7a7a\u95f4\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b\u76f4\u63a5\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4e5f\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "SCoT\u6846\u67b6\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6865\u63a5\u4e86MLLMs\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u7559\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

In this work, we adapt a text-based adversarial attack targeting inflectional morphology to the speech domain and demonstrate that state-of-the-art E2E-ST models are highly vulnerable it. While adversarial training effectively mitigates such risks in text-based tasks, generating high-quality adversarial speech data remains computationally expensive and technically challenging. To address this, we propose Cross-Modal Robustness Transfer (CMRT), a framework that transfers adversarial robustness from the text modality to the speech modality. Our method eliminates the requirement for adversarial speech data during training. Extensive experiments across four language pairs demonstrate that CMRT improves adversarial robustness by an average of more than 3 BLEU points, establishing a new baseline for robust E2E-ST without the overhead of generating adversarial speech.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8f6c\u79fb(CMRT)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u6587\u672c\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5bf9\u6297\u8bed\u97f3\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bed\u97f3\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5f62\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bed\u97f3\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u8981\u5728\"\u5e72\u51c0\"\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u975e\u6bcd\u8bed\u6216\u65b9\u8a00\u8bed\u97f3\u4e2d\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u5c48\u6298\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u5f62\u6001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5bf9\u6297\u8bed\u97f3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u6280\u672f\u6311\u6218\u5927\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8f6c\u79fb(CMRT)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u6587\u672c\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u6001\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u5bf9\u6297\u8bed\u97f3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5229\u7528\u6587\u672c\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u77e5\u8bc6\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u8bed\u97f3\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCMRT\u5c06\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc73\u4e2aBLEU\u70b9\uff0c\u4e3a\u65e0\u9700\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u6297\u8bed\u97f3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bed\u97f3\u7ffb\u8bd1\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "conclusion": "CMRT\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bed\u97f3\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5f62\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8f6c\u79fb\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u8bed\u97f3\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This work investigates the potential of generative AI (GenAI) methods to improve activity recognition from such videos. Specifically, we explore the use of local vision-language models (VLMs), combined with large language models (LLMs), and compare them to a supervised TimeSFormer baseline. Using a simulated dataset comprising 13.26 hours of newborn resuscitation videos, we evaluate several zero-shot VLM-based strategies and fine-tuned VLMs with classification heads, including Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA).

Detecting and Rewriting Underspecified Questions Improve QA Performance", "comment": "4 pages of main text, 13 pages in total, 5 tables and 10 figures in total", "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) perform well on well-posed questions, yet standard question-answering (QA) benchmarks remain far from solved. We argue that this gap is partly due to underspecified questions - queries whose interpretation cannot be uniquely determined without additional context. To test this hypothesis, we introduce an LLM-based classifier to identify underspecified questions and apply it to several widely used QA datasets, finding that 16% to over 50% of benchmark questions are underspecified and that LLMs perform significantly worse on them. To isolate the effect of underspecification, we conduct a controlled rewriting experiment that serves as an upper-bound analysis, rewriting underspecified questions into fully specified variants while holding gold answers fixed. QA performance consistently improves under this setting, indicating that many apparent QA failures stem from question underspecification rather than model limitations. Our findings highlight underspecification as an important confound in QA evaluation and motivate greater attention to question clarity in benchmark design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6\u4e2d\u5927\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\u5b58\u5728\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e0d\u6e05\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u5bfc\u81f4\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u6a21\u578b\u672c\u8eab\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b9a\u4e49\u660e\u786e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u6807\u51c6\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6\u4ecd\u8fdc\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8fd9\u79cd\u5dee\u8ddd\u90e8\u5206\u6e90\u4e8e\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e0d\u6e05\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u2014\u2014\u90a3\u4e9b\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u989d\u5916\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u65e0\u6cd5\u552f\u4e00\u786e\u5b9a\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e0d\u6e05\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u4e2a\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684QA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b\u8fdb\u884c\u53d7\u63a7\u91cd\u5199\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5c06\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e0d\u6e05\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u91cd\u5199\u4e3a\u5b8c\u5168\u5b9a\u4e49\u660e\u786e\u7684\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848\u4e0d\u53d8\uff0c\u4ee5\u6b64\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e0a\u9650\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2aQA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b016%\u5230\u8d85\u8fc750%\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u95ee\u9898\u662f\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e0d\u6e05\u7684\uff1bLLM\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u5dee\uff1b\u5728\u53d7\u63a7\u91cd\u5199\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cQA\u6027\u80fd\u4e00\u81f4\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8bb8\u591a\u660e\u663e\u7684QA\u5931\u8d25\u6e90\u4e8e\u95ee\u9898\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e0d\u6e05\u800c\u975e\u6a21\u578b\u9650\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e0d\u6e05\u662fQA\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6df7\u6dc6\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u52a0\u5173\u6ce8\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\u3002"}}

While recent studies have exploited behavior-related prompts adjustment to enhance reasoning, these designs remain largely intuitive and lack a systematic analysis of the underlying behavioral patterns. Motivated by this, we investigate how models' reasoning behaviors shape reasoning from the perspective of behavioral patterns. We observe that models exhibit adaptive distributions of reasoning behaviors when responding to specific types of questions, and that structurally injecting these patterns can substantially influence the quality of the models' reasoning processes and outcomes. Building on these findings, we propose two optimization methods that require no parameter updates: InjectCorrect and InjectRLOpt. InjectCorrect guides the model by imitating behavioral patterns derived from its own past correct answers. InjectRLOpt learns a value function from historical behavior-pattern data and, via our proposed Reliability-Aware Softmax Policy, generates behavioral injectant during inference to steer the reasoning process. Our experiments demonstrate that both methods can improve model performance across various reasoning tasks without requiring any modifications to model parameters, achieving gains of up to 5.34% and 8.67%, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u8eab\u63a8\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u76f4\u89c9\u8bbe\u8ba1\u884c\u4e3a\u76f8\u5173\u63d0\u793a\u8c03\u6574\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5e95\u5c42\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u4ece\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\u89d2\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u5982\u4f55\u5851\u9020\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1) InjectCorrect\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u4eff\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u8eab\u8fc7\u53bb\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\u6765\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\uff1b2) InjectRLOpt\uff1a\u4ece\u5386\u53f2\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\u6570\u636e\u5b66\u4e60\u4ef7\u503c\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u611f\u77e5Softmax\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u884c\u4e3a\u6ce8\u5165\u7269\u6765\u5f15\u5bfc\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u90fd\u80fd\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u83b7\u5f97\u9ad8\u8fbe5.34%\u548c8.67%\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56de\u7b54\u7279\u5b9a\u7c7b\u578b\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a8\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u5730\u6ce8\u5165\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u5f0f\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u548c\u7ed3\u679c\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u65e0\u9700\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

While Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) provides a formal framework, existing methods often lack the scalability and flexibility required for real-world Unmanned Traffic Management (UTM). We propose DTAPP-IICR: a Delivery-Time Aware Prioritized Planning method with Incremental and Iterative Conflict Resolution. Our framework first generates an initial solution by prioritizing missions based on urgency. Secondly, it computes roundtrip trajectories using SFIPP-ST, a novel 4D single-agent planner (Safe Flight Interval Path Planning with Soft and Temporal Constraints). SFIPP-ST handles heterogeneous UAVs, strictly enforces temporal NFZs, and models inter-agent conflicts as soft constraints. Subsequently, an iterative Large Neighborhood Search, guided by a geometric conflict graph, efficiently resolves any residual conflicts. A completeness-preserving directional pruning technique further accelerates the 3D search. On benchmarks with temporal NFZs, DTAPP-IICR achieves near-100% success with fleets of up to 1,000 UAVs and gains up to 50% runtime reduction from pruning, outperforming batch Enhanced Conflict-Based Search in the UTM context.

High dynamic range (HDR) imaging above 120 dB is essential in these contexts. Conventional CCD/CMOS sensors, with dynamic ranges typically below 70 dB, are highly susceptible to saturation under glare, resulting in irreversible loss of detail and significant errors in digital image correlation (DIC). Methods This paper presents an HDR imaging system that leverages the spatial modulation capability of a digital micromirror device (DMD). The system architecture enables autonomous regional segmentation and adaptive exposure control for high-dynamic-range scenes through an integrated framework comprising two synergistic subsystems: a DMD-based optical modulation unit and an adaptive computational imaging pipeline. Results The system achieves a measurable dynamic range of 127 dB, effectively eliminating satu ration artifacts under high glare. Experimental results demonstrate a 78% reduction in strain error and improved DIC positioning accuracy, confirming reliable performance across extreme intensity variations. Conclusion The DMD-based system provides high fidelity adaptive HDR imaging, overcoming key limitations of conventional sensors. It exhibits strong potential for optical metrology and stress analysis in high-glare environments where traditional methods are inadequate.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u5b57\u5fae\u955c\u5668\u4ef6(DMD)\u7684\u9ad8\u52a8\u6001\u8303\u56f4\u6210\u50cf\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u710a\u63a5\u7535\u5f27\u76d1\u6d4b\u548c\u629b\u5149\u91d1\u5c5e\u8868\u9762\u5206\u6790\u7b49\u6781\u7aef\u5149\u7167\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u5149\u529b\u5b66\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0127dB\u52a8\u6001\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u5e94\u53d8\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfCCD/CMOS\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u52a8\u6001\u8303\u56f4\u901a\u5e38\u4f4e\u4e8e70dB\uff0c\u5728\u710a\u63a5\u7535\u5f27\u76d1\u6d4b\u548c\u629b\u5149\u91d1\u5c5e\u8868\u9762\u5206\u6790\u7b49\u9ad8\u5149\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5bb9\u6613\u9971\u548c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6570\u5b57\u56fe\u50cf\u76f8\u5173(DIC)\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e2d\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\u4e22\u5931\u548c\u663e\u8457\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u5b57\u5fae\u955c\u5668\u4ef6(DMD)\u7684HDR\u6210\u50cf\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u534f\u540c\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\uff1aDMD\u5149\u5b66\u8c03\u5236\u5355\u5143\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u50cf\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u4e3b\u533a\u57df\u5206\u5272\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u66dd\u5149\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u73b0127dB\u53ef\u6d4b\u91cf\u52a8\u6001\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6d88\u9664\u9ad8\u5149\u4e0b\u7684\u9971\u548c\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5e94\u53d8\u8bef\u5dee\u51cf\u5c1178%\uff0cDIC\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad8\uff0c\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u5f3a\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u3002", "conclusion": "DMD\u57fa\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94HDR\u6210\u50cf\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4f20\u7edf\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5173\u952e\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u5149\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u5149\u5b66\u8ba1\u91cf\u548c\u5e94\u529b\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, existing methods lack mechanisms to verify intermediate reasoning steps, allowing errors such as inapplicable statute citations to propagate undetected through the reasoning chain. To address this, we propose LawThinker, an autonomous legal research agent that adopts an Explore-Verify-Memorize strategy for dynamic judicial environments. The core idea is to enforce verification as an atomic operation after every knowledge exploration step. A DeepVerifier module examines each retrieval result along three dimensions of knowledge accuracy, fact-law relevance, and procedural compliance, with a memory module for cross-round knowledge reuse in long-horizon tasks. Experiments on the dynamic benchmark J1-EVAL show that LawThinker achieves a 24% improvement over direct reasoning and an 11% gain over workflow-based methods, with particularly strong improvements on process-oriented metrics. Evaluations on three static benchmarks further confirm its generalization capability.

Models must generate text, layout, style, and visual elements while preserving semantic fidelity and aesthetic coherence. The process spans two regimes: local editing, where ID-driven generation, rescaling, filling, and extending must preserve concrete visual entities; and global creation, where layout- and style-driven tasks rely on understanding abstract design concepts. These intertwined demands make image-to-poster a multi-dimensional process coupling entity-preserving editing with concept-driven creation under image-prompt control. To address these challenges, we propose PosterOmni, a generalized artistic poster creation framework that unlocks the potential of a base edit model for multi-task image-to-poster generation. PosterOmni integrates the two regimes, namely local editing and global creation, within a single system through an efficient data-distillation-reward pipeline: (i) constructing multi-scenario image-to-poster datasets covering six task types across entity-based and concept-based creation; (ii) distilling knowledge between local and global experts for supervised fine-tuning; and (iii) applying unified PosterOmni Reward Feedback to jointly align visual entity-preserving and aesthetic preference across all tasks. Additionally, we establish PosterOmni-Bench, a unified benchmark for evaluating both local editing and global creation. Extensive experiments show that PosterOmni significantly enhances reference adherence, global composition quality, and aesthetic harmony, outperforming all open-source baselines and even surpassing several proprietary systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "PosterOmni\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u6d77\u62a5\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u84b8\u998f\u5956\u52b1\u7ba1\u9053\u6574\u5408\u5c40\u90e8\u7f16\u8f91\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u521b\u5efa\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u5f00\u6e90\u57fa\u7ebf\u751a\u81f3\u90e8\u5206\u4e13\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u6d77\u62a5\u751f\u6210\u9700\u8981\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u5c40\u90e8\u8c03\u6574\u548c\u9ad8\u5c42\u6b21\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u6d89\u53ca\u6587\u672c\u3001\u5e03\u5c40\u3001\u98ce\u683c\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u7f8e\u5b66\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b9e\u4f53\u4fdd\u6301\u7f16\u8f91\u548c\u6982\u5ff5\u9a71\u52a8\u521b\u5efa\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPosterOmni\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6570\u636e\u84b8\u998f\u5956\u52b1\u7ba1\u9053\u6574\u5408\u5c40\u90e8\u7f16\u8f91\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u521b\u5efa\uff1a1)\u6784\u5efa\u8986\u76d66\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u591a\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u6d77\u62a5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b2)\u5728\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u4e13\u5bb6\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u4ee5\u8fdb\u884c\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff1b3)\u5e94\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u7684PosterOmni\u5956\u52b1\u53cd\u9988\u6765\u8054\u5408\u5bf9\u9f50\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9e\u4f53\u4fdd\u6301\u548c\u7f8e\u5b66\u504f\u597d\u3002", "result": "PosterOmni\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u53c2\u8003\u9075\u5faa\u6027\u3001\u5168\u5c40\u6784\u56fe\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u7f8e\u5b66\u548c\u8c10\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u6240\u6709\u5f00\u6e90\u57fa\u7ebf\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u51e0\u4e2a\u4e13\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86PosterOmni-Bench\u7edf\u4e00\u57fa\u51c6\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u5c40\u90e8\u7f16\u8f91\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u521b\u5efa\u3002", "conclusion": "PosterOmni\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u6d77\u62a5\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u5b9e\u4f53\u4fdd\u6301\u7f16\u8f91\u548c\u6982\u5ff5\u9a71\u52a8\u521b\u5efa\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u6d77\u62a5\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4e3a\u827a\u672f\u6d77\u62a5\u521b\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Especially the capacity of Small Language Models (SLMs) is limited, leading to factually incorrect generations. This problem is often mitigated by giving the SLM access to an outside source: the ability to query a larger model, documents, or a database. Under this setting, we study the fundamental question of \\emph{which tokens an SLM can and should learn} during pretraining, versus \\emph{which ones it should delegate} via a \\texttt{<CALL>} token. We find that this is not simply a question of loss: although the loss is predictive of whether a predicted token mismatches the ground-truth, some tokens are \\emph{acceptable} in that they are truthful alternative continuations of a pretraining document, and should not trigger a \\texttt{<CALL>} even if their loss is high. We find that a spaCy grammar parser can help augment the loss signal to decide which tokens the SLM should learn to delegate to prevent factual errors and which are safe to learn and predict even under high losses. We propose LaCy, a novel pretraining method based on this token selection philosophy. Our experiments demonstrate that LaCy models successfully learn which tokens to predict and where to delegate for help. This results in higher FactScores when generating in a cascade with a bigger model and outperforms Rho or LLM-judge trained SLMs, while being simpler and cheaper.", "AI": {"tldr": "LaCy\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u5668\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u667a\u80fd\u9009\u62e9\u54ea\u4e9btoken\u5e94\u8be5\u5b66\u4e60\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u54ea\u4e9b\u5e94\u8be5\u59d4\u6258\u7ed9\u5927\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u6027", "motivation": "\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u5bb9\u91cf\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u867d\u7136\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbf\u95ee\u5916\u90e8\u8d44\u6e90\uff08\u5982\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u6587\u6863\u3001\u6570\u636e\u5e93\uff09\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u672c\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\uff0c\u54ea\u4e9btoken\u5e94\u8be5\u5b66\u4e60\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u54ea\u4e9b\u5e94\u8be5\u901a\u8fc7<CALL>\u59d4\u6258\u7ed9\u5916\u90e8\u8d44\u6e90", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLaCy\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528spaCy\u8bed\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u5668\u589e\u5f3a\u635f\u5931\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u54ea\u4e9btoken\u662f\"\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\"\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u66ff\u4ee3\u5ef6\u7eed\uff08\u5373\u4f7f\u635f\u5931\u9ad8\uff09\uff0c\u54ea\u4e9b\u662f\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9519\u8bef\u7684token\u9700\u8981\u59d4\u6258\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u79cdtoken\u9009\u62e9\u54f2\u5b66\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3", "result": "LaCy\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u529f\u5b66\u4f1a\u4e86\u54ea\u4e9btoken\u5e94\u8be5\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u54ea\u4e9b\u5e94\u8be5\u59d4\u6258\u3002\u5728\u4e0e\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7ea7\u8054\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684FactScore\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8eRho\u6216LLM-judge\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684SLM\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u66f4\u4fbf\u5b9c", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u5668\u8f85\u52a9\u7684token\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u66f4\u667a\u80fd\u5730\u51b3\u5b9a\u4f55\u65f6\u81ea\u884c\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u4f55\u65f6\u59d4\u6258\u7ed9\u5916\u90e8\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7b80\u5355\u548c\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca"}}

In the world of AI, while we possess the Pensieve-mature databases and retrieval systems, our models inexplicably lack the \"wand\" to operate it. They remain like a Dumbledore without agency, passively accepting a manually engineered context as their entire memory. This work finally places the wand in the model's hand. We introduce StateLM, a new class of foundation models endowed with an internal reasoning loop to manage their own state. We equip our model with a suite of memory tools, such as context pruning, document indexing, and note-taking, and train it to actively manage these tools. By learning to dynamically engineering its own context, our model breaks free from the architectural prison of a fixed window. Experiments across various model sizes demonstrate StateLM's effectiveness across diverse scenarios. On long-document QA tasks, StateLMs consistently outperform standard LLMs across all model scales; on the chat memory task, they achieve absolute accuracy improvements of 10% to 20% over standard LLMs. On the deep research task BrowseComp-Plus, the performance gap becomes even more pronounced: StateLM achieves up to 52% accuracy, whereas standard LLM counterparts struggle around 5%.

Preference optimization methods address this but require costly preference pairs or reward modeling. We propose Flow Matching Adversarial Imitation Learning (FAIL), which minimizes policy-expert divergence through adversarial training without explicit rewards or pairwise comparisons. We derive two algorithms: FAIL-PD exploits differentiable ODE solvers for low-variance pathwise gradients, while FAIL-PG provides a black-box alternative for discrete or computationally constrained settings. Fine-tuning FLUX with only 13,000 demonstrations from Nano Banana pro, FAIL achieves competitive performance on prompt following and aesthetic benchmarks.

However, they often generate over-long chains-of-thought that, driven by substantial reflections such as repetitive self-questioning and circular reasoning, lead to high token consumption, substantial computational overhead, and increased latency without improving accuracy, particularly in smaller models. Our observation reveals that increasing problem complexity induces more excessive and unnecessary reflection, which in turn reduces accuracy and increases token overhead. To address this challenge, we propose Adaptive Reflection and Length Coordinated Penalty (ARLCP), a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to dynamically balance reasoning efficiency and solution accuracy. ARLCP introduces two key innovations: (1) a reflection penalty that adaptively curtails unnecessary reflective steps while preserving essential reasoning, and (2) a length penalty calibrated to the estimated complexity of the problem. By coordinating these penalties, ARLCP encourages the model to generate more concise and effective reasoning paths. We evaluate our method on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks using DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B models. Experimental results show that ARLCP achieves a superior efficiency-accuracy trade-off compared to existing approaches. For the 1.5B model, it reduces the average response length by 53.1% while simultaneously improving accuracy by 5.8%. For the 7B model, it achieves a 35.0% reduction in length with a 2.7% accuracy gain.

Recent studies focus on better exploiting limited training data by prioritizing hard prompts whose rollout pass rate is 0. However, easy prompts with a pass rate of 1 also become increasingly prevalent as training progresses, thereby reducing the effective data size. To mitigate this, we propose Composition-RL, a simple yet useful approach for better utilizing limited verifiable prompts targeting pass-rate-1 prompts. More specifically, Composition-RL automatically composes multiple problems into a new verifiable question and uses these compositional prompts for RL training. Extensive experiments across model sizes from 4B to 30B show that Composition-RL consistently improves reasoning capability over RL trained on the original dataset. Performance can be further boosted with a curriculum variant of Composition-RL that gradually increases compositional depth over training. Additionally, Composition-RL enables more effective cross-domain RL by composing prompts drawn from different domains.

However, existing approaches typically treat human-centric tasks including reference-based audio-video generation (R2AV), video editing (RV2AV) and audio-driven video animation (RA2V) as isolated objectives. Furthermore, achieving precise, disentangled control over multiple character identities and voice timbres within a single framework remains an open challenge. In this paper, we propose DreamID-Omni, a unified framework for controllable human-centric audio-video generation. Specifically, we design a Symmetric Conditional Diffusion Transformer that integrates heterogeneous conditioning signals via a symmetric conditional injection scheme. To resolve the pervasive identity-timbre binding failures and speaker confusion in multi-person scenarios, we introduce a Dual-Level Disentanglement strategy: Synchronized RoPE at the signal level to ensure rigid attention-space binding, and Structured Captions at the semantic level to establish explicit attribute-subject mappings. Furthermore, we devise a Multi-Task Progressive Training scheme that leverages weakly-constrained generative priors to regularize strongly-constrained tasks, preventing overfitting and harmonizing disparate objectives. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DreamID-Omni achieves comprehensive state-of-the-art performance across video, audio, and audio-visual consistency, even outperforming leading proprietary commercial models.

It relies on computing pairwise relations between tokens. To reduce the high computational cost of standard quadratic attention, linear attention has been proposed as an efficient approximation. It employs kernel functions that are applied independently to the inputs before the pairwise similarities are calculated. That allows for an efficient computational procedure which, however, amounts to a low-degree rational function approximating softmax.\n  We propose Hadamard Linear Attention (HLA). Unlike previous works on linear attention, the nonlinearity in HLA is not applied separately to queries and keys, but, analogously to standard softmax attention, after the pairwise similarities have been computed. It will be shown that the proposed nonlinearity amounts to a higher-degree rational function to approximate softmax. An efficient computational scheme for the proposed method is derived that is similar to that of standard linear attention. In contrast to other approaches, no time-consuming tensor reshaping is necessary to apply the proposed algorithm. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated by applying it to a large diffusion transformer model for video generation, an application that involves very large amounts of tokens.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faHadamard\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b(HLA)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u540e\u5e94\u7528\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u9ad8\u9636\u6709\u7406\u51fd\u6570\u903c\u8fd1softmax\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u7ebf\u6027\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5f20\u91cf\u91cd\u5851\uff0c\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u4e8c\u6b21\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4f7f\u7528\u6838\u51fd\u6570\u72ec\u7acb\u5904\u7406\u8f93\u5165\u540e\u8ba1\u7b97\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u53ea\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u9636\u6709\u7406\u51fd\u6570\u903c\u8fd1softmax\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHadamard\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b(HLA)\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5728\u67e5\u8be2\u548c\u952e\u4e0a\u72ec\u7acb\u5e94\u7528\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\uff0cHLA\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u5b8c\u6210\u5bf9\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u540e\u5e94\u7528\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u9ad8\u9636\u6709\u7406\u51fd\u6570\u903c\u8fd1softmax\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u7c7b\u4f3c\u6807\u51c6\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5f20\u91cf\u91cd\u5851\u3002", "result": "HLA\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u9636\u6709\u7406\u51fd\u6570\u903c\u8fd1softmax\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u7ebf\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u8be5\u5e94\u7528\u6d89\u53ca\u5927\u91cftoken\u5904\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "HLA\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u540e\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684softmax\u903c\u8fd1\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u5408\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21token\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

A key challenge is obtaining accurate, user-specific reward signals in open-ended scenarios. Existing personalized reward models face two persistent limitations: (1) oversimplifying diverse, scenario-specific preferences into a small, fixed set of evaluation principles, and (2) struggling with generalization to new users with limited feedback. To this end, we propose P-GenRM, the first Personalized Generative Reward Model with test-time user-based scaling. P-GenRM transforms preference signals into structured evaluation chains that derive adaptive personas and scoring rubrics across various scenarios. It further clusters users into User Prototypes and introduces a dual-granularity scaling mechanism: at the individual level, it adaptively scales and aggregates each user's scoring scheme; at the prototype level, it incorporates preferences from similar users. This design mitigates noise in inferred preferences and enhances generalization to unseen users through prototype-based transfer. Empirical results show that P-GenRM achieves state-of-the-art results on widely-used personalized reward model benchmarks, with an average improvement of 2.31%, and demonstrates strong generalization on an out-of-distribution dataset. Notably, Test-time User-based scaling provides an additional 3% boost, demonstrating stronger personalized alignment with test-time scalability.", "AI": {"tldr": "P-GenRM\uff1a\u9996\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7528\u6237\u7ea7\u7f29\u653e\u529f\u80fd\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u751f\u6210\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u89d2\u8272\u548c\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\u89e3\u51b3\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e2d\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u83b7\u53d6\u96be\u9898", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u9650\u5236\uff1a1\uff09\u5c06\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u573a\u666f\u7279\u5b9a\u504f\u597d\u8fc7\u5ea6\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\u5c11\u91cf\u56fa\u5b9a\u8bc4\u4f30\u539f\u5219\uff1b2\uff09\u5bf9\u6709\u9650\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u65b0\u7528\u6237\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7cbe\u51c6\u7684\u7528\u6237\u7279\u5b9a\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5bf9\u9f50", "method": "P-GenRM\u5c06\u504f\u597d\u4fe1\u53f7\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u94fe\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u8de8\u573a\u666f\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u89d2\u8272\u548c\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7528\u6237\u539f\u578b\u805a\u7c7b\u548c\u53cc\u7c92\u5ea6\u7f29\u653e\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u4e2a\u4f53\u5c42\u9762\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7f29\u653e\u805a\u5408\u7528\u6237\u8bc4\u5206\u65b9\u6848\uff1b\u539f\u578b\u5c42\u9762\u6574\u5408\u76f8\u4f3c\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u63a8\u65ad\u504f\u597d\u566a\u58f0\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u672a\u89c1\u7528\u6237\u6cdb\u5316", "result": "\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u53472.31%\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7528\u6237\u7ea7\u7f29\u653e\u989d\u5916\u63d0\u4f9b3%\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027", "conclusion": "P-GenRM\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u94fe\u3001\u7528\u6237\u539f\u578b\u805a\u7c7b\u548c\u53cc\u7c92\u5ea6\u7f29\u653e\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u597d\u8fc7\u5ea6\u7b80\u5316\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7cbe\u51c6\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7"}}

The analysis employed a rigorous pipeline combining hybrid color normalization, facial landmark masking, and perceptually uniform skin tone quantification using the Monk (MST), PERLA, and Fitzpatrick scales. Neutral prompts produced highly polarized defaults. Both models exhibited a strong \"default white\" bias (>96% of outputs). However, they diverged sharply on gender: Gemini favored female-presenting subjects, while GPT favored male-presenting subjects with lighter skin tones. This research provides a large-scale, comparative audit of state-of-the-art models using an illumination-aware colorimetric methodology, distinguishing aesthetic rendering from underlying pigmentation in synthetic imagery.

In this work, we present DeepGen 1.0, a lightweight 5B unified model that achieves comprehensive capabilities competitive with or surpassing much larger counterparts. To overcome the limitations of compact models in semantic understanding and fine-grained control, we introduce Stacked Channel Bridging (SCB), a deep alignment framework that extracts hierarchical features from multiple VLM layers and fuses them with learnable 'think tokens' to provide the generative backbone with structured, reasoning-rich guidance. We further design a data-centric training strategy spanning three progressive stages: (1) Alignment Pre-training on large-scale image-text pairs and editing triplets to synchronize VLM and DiT representations, (2) Joint Supervised Fine-tuning on a high-quality mixture of generation, editing, and reasoning tasks to foster omni-capabilities, and (3) Reinforcement Learning with MR-GRPO, which leverages a mixture of reward functions and supervision signals, resulting in substantial gains in generation quality and alignment with human preferences, while maintaining stable training progress and avoiding visual artifacts. Despite being trained on only ~50M samples, DeepGen 1.0 achieves leading performance across diverse benchmarks, surpassing the 80B HunyuanImage by 28% on WISE and the 27B Qwen-Image-Edit by 37% on UniREditBench.

This paper describes work-in-progress to construct a rule-based model of Gaidhlig morphology using data from Wiktionary, arguing that rule-based systems effectively leverage limited sample data, support greater interpretability, and provide insights useful in the design of teaching materials. The use of SQL for querying the occurrence of different lexical patterns is investigated, and a declarative rule-base is presented that allows Python utilities to derive inflected forms of Gaidhlig words. This functionality could be used to support educational tools that teach or explain language patterns, for example, or to support higher level tools such as rule-based dependency parsers.

We introduce the Value Alignment Tax (VAT), a framework that measures how alignment-induced changes propagate across interconnected values relative to achieved on-target gain. VAT captures the dynamics of value expression under alignment pressure. Using a controlled scenario-action dataset grounded in Schwartz value theory, we collect paired pre-post normative judgments and analyze alignment effects across models, values, and alignment strategies. Our results show that alignment often produces uneven, structured co-movement among values.

However, current evaluations predominantly adhere to text-generation standards, overlooking the unique audio-centric characteristics of paralinguistics and colloquialisms, alongside the cognitive depth required by modern agents. To bridge this gap, we introduce WavBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate realistic conversational abilities where prior works fall short. Uniquely, WavBench establishes a tripartite framework: 1) Pro subset, designed to rigorously challenge reasoning-enhanced models with significantly increased difficulty; 2) Basic subset, defining a novel standard for spoken colloquialism that prioritizes \"listenability\" through natural vocabulary, linguistic fluency, and interactive rapport, rather than rigid written accuracy; and 3) Acoustic subset, covering explicit understanding, generation, and implicit dialogue to rigorously evaluate comprehensive paralinguistic capabilities within authentic real-world scenarios. Through evaluating five state-of-the-art models, WavBench offers critical insights into the intersection of complex problem-solving, colloquial delivery, and paralinguistic fidelity, guiding the evolution of robust spoken dialogue models.

In this setting, we find that prior sparse-attention approximations break down, despite showing strong results for bidirectional, many-step diffusion. Specifically, we observe that video attention is not reliably sparse, but instead combines pronounced periodic structure driven by spatiotemporal position with dynamic, sparse semantic correspondences and dense mixing, exceeding the representational capacity of even oracle top-k attention. Building on this insight, we propose Monarch-RT, a structured attention parameterization for video diffusion models that factorizes attention using Monarch matrices. Through appropriately aligned block structure and our extended tiled Monarch parameterization, we achieve high expressivity while preserving computational efficiency. We further overcome the overhead of parameterization through finetuning, with custom Triton kernels. We first validate the high efficacy of Monarch-RT over existing sparse baselines designed only for bidirectional models. We further observe that Monarch-RT attains up to 95% attention sparsity with no loss in quality when applied to the state-of-the-art model Self-Forcing, making Monarch-RT a pioneering work on highly-capable sparse attention parameterization for real-time video generation. Our optimized implementation outperforms FlashAttention-2, FlashAttention-3, and FlashAttention-4 kernels on Nvidia RTX 5090, H100, and B200 GPUs respectively, providing kernel speedups in the range of 1.4-11.8X.

These deliberations are formally documented in meeting minutes, which serve as official records of discussions, decisions, and voting outcomes. Despite their importance, municipal meeting records have received little attention in Information Retrieval (IR) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), largely due to the lack of annotated datasets, which ultimately limit the development of computational models. To address this gap, we introduce CitiLink-Minutes, a multilayer dataset of 120 European Portuguese municipal meeting minutes from six municipalities. Unlike prior annotated datasets of parliamentary or video records, CitiLink-Minutes provides multilayer annotations and structured linkage of official written minutes. The dataset contains over one million tokens, with all personal identifiers de-identified. Each minute was manually annotated by two trained annotators and curated by an experienced linguist across three complementary dimensions: (1) metadata, (2) subjects of discussion, and (3) voting outcomes, totaling over 38,000 individual annotations. Released under FAIR principles and accompanied by baseline results on metadata extraction, topic classification, and vote labeling, CitiLink-Minutes demonstrates its potential for downstream NLP and IR tasks, while promoting transparent access to municipal decisions.", "AI": {"tldr": "CitiLink-Minutes\uff1a\u9996\u4e2a\u591a\u5c42\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u6b27\u6d32\u8461\u8404\u7259\u8bed\u5e02\u653f\u4f1a\u8bae\u8bb0\u5f55\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b120\u4efd\u4f1a\u8bae\u7eaa\u8981\u3001\u8d85\u8fc7100\u4e07\u8bcd\u5143\u300138,000\u4e2a\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5143\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u53d6\u3001\u4e3b\u9898\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u6295\u7968\u6807\u6ce8\u7b49NLP\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e02\u653f\u4f1a\u8bae\u8bb0\u5f55\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5730\u65b9\u6cbb\u7406\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6587\u4ef6\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5f71\u54cd\u516c\u6c11\u65e5\u5e38\u751f\u6d3b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u9886\u57df\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u6536\u96c6\u4e866\u4e2a\u5e02\u653f\u673a\u6784\u7684120\u4efd\u6b27\u6d32\u8461\u8404\u7259\u8bed\u5e02\u653f\u4f1a\u8bae\u8bb0\u5f55\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u5c42\u6807\u6ce8\uff1a1) \u5143\u6570\u636e\u6807\u6ce8\uff1b2) \u8ba8\u8bba\u4e3b\u9898\u6807\u6ce8\uff1b3) \u6295\u7968\u7ed3\u679c\u6807\u6ce8\u3002\u6240\u6709\u4e2a\u4eba\u6807\u8bc6\u7b26\u5df2\u53bb\u6807\u8bc6\u5316\uff0c\u6bcf\u4efd\u8bb0\u5f55\u7531\u4e24\u540d\u8bad\u7ec3\u6709\u7d20\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u5458\u624b\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u5e76\u7531\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u5bb6\u5ba1\u6838\u3002", "result": "\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u8d85\u8fc7100\u4e07\u8bcd\u5143\u300138,000\u4e2a\u4e2a\u4f53\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u591a\u5c42\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u9075\u5faaFAIR\u539f\u5219\u53d1\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5143\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u53d6\u3001\u4e3b\u9898\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u6295\u7968\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "CitiLink-Minutes\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u5e02\u653f\u4f1a\u8bae\u8bb0\u5f55\u5728NLP\u548cIR\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u5e02\u653f\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u900f\u660e\u8bbf\u95ee\u3002"}}

Research into this question has focused on evaluating LLMs against benchmarks and found success across a range of social tasks. However, these evaluations do not test for the actual representations posited by ToM: namely, a causal model of mental states and behavior. Here, we use a cognitively-grounded definition of ToM to develop and test a new evaluation framework. Specifically, our approach probes whether LLMs have a coherent, domain-general, and consistent model of how mental states cause behavior -- regardless of whether that model matches a human-like ToM. We find that even though LLMs succeed in approximating human judgments in a simple ToM paradigm, they fail at a logically equivalent task and exhibit low consistency between their action predictions and corresponding mental state inferences.

In this work, we introduce Progressive Semantic Illusions, a novel vector sketching task where a single sketch undergoes a dramatic semantic transformation through the sequential addition of strokes. We present Stroke of Surprise, a generative framework that optimizes vector strokes to satisfy distinct semantic interpretations at different drawing stages. The core challenge lies in the \"dual-constraint\": initial prefix strokes must form a coherent object (e.g., a duck) while simultaneously serving as the structural foundation for a second concept (e.g., a sheep) upon adding delta strokes. To address this, we propose a sequence-aware joint optimization framework driven by a dual-branch Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) mechanism. Unlike sequential approaches that freeze the initial state, our method dynamically adjusts prefix strokes to discover a \"common structural subspace\" valid for both targets. Furthermore, we introduce a novel Overlay Loss that enforces spatial complementarity, ensuring structural integration rather than occlusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in recognizability and illusion strength, successfully expanding visual anagrams from the spatial to the temporal dimension.

However, in scientific reasoning tasks, these models remain fragile due to unreliable solution evaluation and limited diversity in verification strategies. In this work, we propose Sci-CoE, a two-stage scientific co-evolving framework that enables models to self-evolve as both solver and verifier through a transition from sparse supervision to unsupervised learning. In the first stage, the model uses a small set of annotated data to establish fundamental correctness judgment anchors for the Verifier. In the second stage, we introduce a geometric reward mechanism that jointly considers consensus, reliability, and diversity, driving large-scale self-iteration on unlabeled data. Experiments on several general scientific benchmarks demonstrate that Sci-CoE enhances complex reasoning capabilities and exhibits strong scalability, facilitating the construction of more robust and diverse evaluation systems.

This paper introduces the visual reasoning benchmark (VRB), a novel dataset designed to evaluate Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on their ability to solve authentic visual problems from classrooms. This benchmark is built on a set of 701 questions sourced from primary school examinations in Zambia and India, which cover a range of tasks such as reasoning by analogy, pattern completion, and spatial matching. We outline the methodology and development of the benchmark which intentionally uses unedited, minimal-text images to test if models can meet realistic needs of primary education. Our findings reveal a ``jagged frontier'' of capability where models demonstrate better proficiency in static skills such as counting and scaling, but reach a distinct ``spatial ceiling'' when faced with dynamic operations like folding, reflection, and rotation. These weaknesses pose a risk for classroom use on visual reasoning problems, with the potential for incorrect marking, false scaffolding, and reinforcing student misconceptions. Consequently, education-focused benchmarks like the VRB are essential for determining the functional boundaries of multimodal tools used in classrooms.", "AI": {"tldr": "VRB\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u8bfe\u5802\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9759\u6001\u6280\u80fd\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "motivation": "AI\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6587\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u4e0a\u5df2\u53d6\u5f97\u5148\u8fdb\u6210\u679c\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u7ed3\u6784\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u5173\u952e\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4f9d\u8d56\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u6570\u5b66\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u3002\u9700\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30MLLMs\u89e3\u51b3\u771f\u5b9e\u8bfe\u5802\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaVRB\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b701\u9053\u6765\u81ea\u8d5e\u6bd4\u4e9a\u548c\u5370\u5ea6\u5c0f\u5b66\u8003\u8bd5\u7684\u9898\u76ee\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u7c7b\u6bd4\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u6a21\u5f0f\u5b8c\u6210\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u5339\u914d\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u672a\u7ecf\u7f16\u8f91\u3001\u6587\u672c\u6700\u5c11\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u6765\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5426\u6ee1\u8db3\u5c0f\u5b66\u6559\u80b2\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u5b58\u5728\"\u952f\u9f7f\u72b6\u8fb9\u754c\"\uff1a\u5728\u8ba1\u6570\u548c\u7f29\u653e\u7b49\u9759\u6001\u6280\u80fd\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6298\u53e0\u3001\u53cd\u5c04\u548c\u65cb\u8f6c\u7b49\u52a8\u6001\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u660e\u663e\u7684\"\u7a7a\u95f4\u5929\u82b1\u677f\"\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5f31\u70b9\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u9519\u8bef\u8bc4\u5206\u3001\u865a\u5047\u652f\u67b6\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u751f\u8bef\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u50cfVRB\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u6559\u80b2\u5bfc\u5411\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5bf9\u4e8e\u786e\u5b9a\u8bfe\u5802\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u8fb9\u754c\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

However, current methods for distillation via synthetic data lack pedagogical awareness, treating knowledge transfer as a one-off data synthesis and training task rather than a systematic learning process. In this paper, we propose a novel pedagogically-inspired framework for LLM knowledge distillation that draws from fundamental educational principles. Our approach introduces a three-stage pipeline -- Knowledge Identifier, Organizer, and Adapter (IOA) -- that systematically identifies knowledge deficiencies in student models, organizes knowledge delivery through progressive curricula, and adapts representations to match the cognitive capacity of student models. We integrate Bloom's Mastery Learning Principles and Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development to create a dynamic distillation process where student models approach teacher model's performance on prerequisite knowledge before advancing, and new knowledge is introduced with controlled, gradual difficulty increments. Extensive experiments using LLaMA-3.1/3.2 and Qwen2.5 as student models demonstrate that IOA achieves significant improvements over baseline distillation methods, with student models retaining 94.7% of teacher performance on DollyEval while using less than 1/10th of the parameters.

Soft compression architectures promise to extend effective context length by replacing long token sequences with smaller sets of learned compressed tokens. Yet, the limits of compressibility -- and when compression begins to erase task-relevant content -- remain underexplored. In this paper, we define \\emph{token overflow} as a regime in which compressed representations no longer contain sufficient information to answer a given query, and propose a methodology to characterize and detect it. In the xRAG soft-compression setting, we find that query-agnostic saturation statistics reliably separate compressed from uncompressed token representations, providing a practical tool for identifying compressed tokens but showing limited overflow detection capability. Lightweight probing classifiers over both query and context xRAG representations detect overflow with 0.72 AUC-ROC on average on HotpotQA, SQuADv2, and TriviaQA datasets, demonstrating that incorporating query information improves detection performance. These results advance from query-independent diagnostics to query-aware detectors, enabling low-cost pre-LLM gating to mitigate compression-induced errors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u8f6f\u538b\u7f29\u67b6\u6784\u4e2dtoken\u6ea2\u51fa\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u67e5\u8be2\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u63a2\u6d4b\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u67e5\u8be2\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u538b\u7f29\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5904\u7406\u6548\u7387\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u3002\u8f6f\u538b\u7f29\u67b6\u6784\u901a\u8fc7\u7528\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u538b\u7f29token\u66ff\u6362\u957ftoken\u5e8f\u5217\u6765\u6269\u5c55\u6709\u6548\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u538b\u7f29\u6781\u9650\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f55\u65f6\u538b\u7f29\u5f00\u59cb\u64e6\u9664\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u5185\u5bb9\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86token\u6ea2\u51fa\u4f5c\u4e3a\u538b\u7f29\u8868\u793a\u4e0d\u518d\u5305\u542b\u8db3\u591f\u4fe1\u606f\u56de\u7b54\u7ed9\u5b9a\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7279\u5f81\u5316\u548c\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5728xRAG\u8f6f\u538b\u7f29\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u67e5\u8be2\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u9971\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u6765\u5206\u79bb\u538b\u7f29\u548c\u672a\u538b\u7f29token\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u63a2\u6d4b\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u67e5\u8be2\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587xRAG\u8868\u793a\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u6ea2\u51fa\u3002", "result": "\u67e5\u8be2\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u9971\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u5206\u79bb\u538b\u7f29\u548c\u672a\u538b\u7f29token\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4f46\u6ea2\u51fa\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u67e5\u8be2\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u63a2\u6d4b\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5728HotpotQA\u3001SQuADv2\u548cTriviaQA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u8fbe\u52300.72 AUC-ROC\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u67e5\u8be2\u65e0\u5173\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4ece\u67e5\u8be2\u65e0\u5173\u8bca\u65ad\u8f6c\u5411\u67e5\u8be2\u611f\u77e5\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u9884LLM\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u6765\u51cf\u8f7b\u538b\u7f29\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u4e3a\u8f6f\u538b\u7f29\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u7559\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

In practice, segmentation prompts are short, structured, and semantically constrained, leading to substantial over-provisioning in text encoder capacity and persistent computational and memory overhead. In this paper, we perform a large-scale anatomical analysis of text prompting in vision-language segmentation, covering 404,796 real prompts across multiple benchmarks. Our analysis reveals severe redundancy: most context windows are underutilized, vocabulary usage is highly sparse, and text embeddings lie on low-dimensional manifold despite high-dimensional representations. Motivated by these findings, we propose SAM3-LiteText, a lightweight text encoding framework that replaces the original SAM3 text encoder with a compact MobileCLIP student that is optimized by knowledge distillation. Extensive experiments on image and video segmentation benchmarks show that SAM3-LiteText reduces text encoder parameters by up to 88%, substantially reducing static memory footprint, while maintaining segmentation performance comparable to the original model.

Full-attention Transformer encoders remain a strong accuracy baseline for automatic speech recognition (ASR) because every frame can directly attend to every other frame, which resolves otherwise locally ambiguous acoustics using distant lexical context. However, this global dependency incurs quadratic complexity in sequence length, inducing an inherent \"encode-the-whole-utterance\" latency profile. For streaming use cases, this causes TTFT to grow linearly with utterance length as the encoder must process the entire prefix before any decoder token can be emitted. To better meet the needs of on-device, streaming ASR use cases we introduce Moonshine v2, an ergodic streaming-encoder ASR model that employs sliding-window self-attention to achieve bounded, low-latency inference while preserving strong local context. Our models achieve state of the art word error rates across standard benchmarks, attaining accuracy on-par with models 6x their size while running significantly faster.

Here, we study this failure mode in a high-stakes task: the transcription of U.S. street names as spoken by U.S. participants. We evaluate 15 models from OpenAI, Deepgram, Google, and Microsoft on recordings from linguistically diverse U.S. speakers and find an average transcription error rate of 44%. We quantify the downstream impact of failed transcriptions by geographic locations and show that mis-transcriptions systematically cause errors for all speakers, but that routing distance errors are twice as large for non-English primary speakers compared to English primary speakers.

Fine-tuning with less than 1,000 synthetic samples improves street name transcription accuracy by nearly 60% (relative to base models) for non-English primary speakers.

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising tools for symbolic equation discovery, owing to their broad domain knowledge and strong reasoning capabilities.

We introduce KeplerAgent, an agentic framework that explicitly follows this scientific reasoning process. The agent coordinates physics-based tools to extract intermediate structure and uses these results to configure symbolic regression engines such as PySINDy and PySR, including their function libraries and structural constraints.

To alleviate this, we propose a trajectory self-distillation framework that improves few-step decoding by distilling the model's own generative trajectories. We incorporate Direct Discriminative Optimization (DDO), a reverse-KL objective that promotes mode-seeking distillation and encourages the student to concentrate on high-probability teacher modes. Across benchmarks, our approach consistently outperforms strong few-step baselines and standard training under tight step budgets.

However, applying reinforcement learning to such settings remains difficult: realistic objectives often lack verifiable rewards and instead emphasize open-ended behaviors; moreover, RL for multi-turn, multi-step agentic tool use is still underexplored; and building and maintaining executable tool environments is costly, limiting scale and coverage. We propose CM2, an RL framework that replaces verifiable outcome rewards with checklist rewards. CM2 decomposes each turn's intended behavior into fine-grained binary criteria with explicit evidence grounding and structured metadata, turning open-ended judging into more stable classification-style decisions. To balance stability and informativeness, our method adopts a strategy of sparse reward assignment but dense evaluation criteria. Training is performed in a scalable LLM-simulated tool environment, avoiding heavy engineering for large tool sets. Experiments show that CM2 consistently improves over supervised fine-tuning. Starting from an 8B Base model and training on an 8k-example RL dataset, CM2 improves over the SFT counterpart by 8 points on tau^-Bench, by 10 points on BFCL-V4, and by 12 points on ToolSandbox. The results match or even outperform similarly sized open-source baselines, including the judging model. CM2 thus provides a scalable recipe for optimizing multi-turn, multi-step tool-using agents without relying on verifiable rewards.

In our work, we propose On-Policy Context Distillation (OPCD), a framework that bridges on-policy distillation with context distillation by training a student model on its own generated trajectories while minimizing reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence against a context-conditioned teacher. We demonstrate the effectiveness of OPCD on two important applications: experiential knowledge distillation, where models extract and consolidate transferable knowledge from their historical solution traces, and system prompt distillation, where models internalize beneficial behaviors encoded in optimized prompts. Across mathematical reasoning, text-based games, and domain-specific tasks, OPCD consistently outperforms baseline methods, achieving higher task accuracy while better preserving out-of-distribution capabilities.

This limitation is especially pronounced in the medical imaging domain, where effective performance requires both robust visual perception and structured reasoning. In this work, we address this gap by proposing VRFT-Aug, a visual reinforcement fine-tuning framework tailored for the medical domain. VRFT-Aug introduces a series of training strategies designed to augment both perception and reasoning, including prior knowledge injection, perception-driven policy refinement, medically informed reward shaping, and behavioral imitation. Together, these methods aim to stabilize and improve the RFT process.\n  Through extensive experiments across multiple medical datasets, we show that our approaches consistently outperform both standard supervised fine-tuning and RFT baselines. Moreover, we provide empirically grounded insights and practical training heuristics that can be generalized to other medical image tasks.
