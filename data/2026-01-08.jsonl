We focus on envy-freeness up to any good (EFX) -- an important fairness notion in fair division of indivisible goods. A central open question in this field is whether EFX allocations always exist for any number of agents. While prior work has established EFX existence for settings with at most three distinct valuations (Prakash HV et al. 2025) and for two types of goods (Gorantla, Marwaha, and Velusamy 2023), the general case remains unresolved.\n  In this paper, we extend the existent knowledge by proving that EFX allocations satisfying Pareto optimality (PO) always exist and can be computed in quasiliniear time when there are two types of goods, given that the valuations are positive. This result strengthens the existing work of (Gorantla, Marwaha, and Velusamy 2023), which only guarantees the existence of EFX allocations without ensuring Pareto optimality. Our findings demonstrate a fairly simple and efficient algorithm constructing an EFX+PO allocation."}

Kumar et al. (2024) prove that agile online gradient descent (OGD), when used to update a monotone bidding strategy through its quantile representation, is strategically robust in repeated first-price auctions: when all bidders employ agile OGD in this way, the auctioneer's average revenue per round is at most the revenue of Myerson's optimal auction, regardless of how she adjusts the reserve price over time.\n  In this work, we show that this strategic robustness guarantee is not unique to agile OGD or to the first-price auction: any no-regret learning algorithm, when fed gradient feedback with respect to the quantile representation, is strategically robust, even if the auction format changes every round, provided the format satisfies allocation monotonicity and voluntary participation. In particular, the multiplicative weights update (MWU) algorithm simultaneously achieves the optimal regret guarantee and the best-known strategic robustness guarantee. At a technical level, our results are established via a simple relation that bridges Myerson's auction theory and standard no-regret learning theory. This showcases the potential of translating standard regret guarantees into strategic robustness guarantees for specific games, without explicitly minimizing any form of swap regret."}

We start with an intrinsic Gaussian curvature-based surface exaggeration technique, which, when coupled with texture, tends to produce over-smoothed renders. To address this, we resort to 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), which has recently been shown to produce realistic free-viewpoint avatars. Given a multiview sequence, we extract a FLAME mesh, solve a curvature-weighted Poisson equation, and obtain its exaggerated form. However, directly deforming the Gaussians yields poor results, necessitating the synthesis of pseudo-ground-truth caricature images by warping each frame to its exaggerated 2D representation using local affine transformations. We then devise a training scheme that alternates real and synthesized supervision, enabling a single Gaussian collection to represent both natural and exaggerated avatars. This scheme improves fidelity, supports local edits, and allows continuous control over the intensity of the caricature. In order to achieve real-time deformations, an efficient interpolation between the original and exaggerated surfaces is introduced. We further analyze and show that it has a bounded deviation from closed-form solutions. In both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, our results outperform prior work, delivering photorealistic, geometry-controlled caricature avatars."}

Achieving this require a nuanced understanding of the relations within scientific literature, surpasses the scope of keyword-based or embedding-based retrieval. Existing retrieval agents mainly focus on the content-level similarities and are unable to decode critical relational dynamics, such as identifying corroborating or conflicting studies or tracing technological lineages, all of which are essential for a comprehensive literature review. Consequently, this fundamental limitation often results in a fragmented knowledge structure, misleading sentiment interpretation, and inadequate modeling of collective scientific progress. To investigate relation-aware retrieval more deeply, we propose SciNetBench, the first Scientific Network Relation-aware Benchmark for literature retrieval agents. Constructed from a corpus of over 18 million AI papers, our benchmark systematically evaluates three levels of relations: ego-centric retrieval of papers with novel knowledge structures, pair-wise identification of scholarly relationships, and path-wise reconstruction of scientific evolutionary trajectories. Through extensive evaluation of three categories of retrieval agents, we find that their accuracy on relation-aware retrieval tasks often falls below 20%, revealing a core shortcoming of current retrieval paradigms. Notably, further experiments on the literature review tasks demonstrate that providing agents with relational ground truth leads to a substantial 23.4% performance improvement in the review quality, validating the critical importance of relation-aware retrieval. We publicly release our benchmark at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SciNetBench/ to support future research on advanced retrieval systems."}

A major challenge is to relight the avatars to match any scene illumination. For high quality relighting, existing methods require subjects to be captured under complex time-multiplexed illumination, such as one-light-at-a-time (OLAT). We propose a new generalized relightable 3D Gaussian head model that can relight any subject observed in a single- or multi-view images without requiring OLAT data for that subject. Our core idea is to learn a mapping from flat-lit 3DGS avatars to corresponding relightable Gaussian parameters for that avatar. Our model consists of two stages: a first stage that models flat-lit 3DGS avatars without OLAT lighting, and a second stage that learns the mapping to physically-based reflectance parameters for high-quality relighting. This two-stage design allows us to train the first stage across diverse existing multi-view datasets without OLAT lighting ensuring cross-subject generalization, where we learn a dataset-specific lighting code for self-supervised lighting alignment. Subsequently, the second stage can be trained on a significantly smaller dataset of subjects captured under OLAT illumination. Together, this allows our method to generalize well and relight any subject from the first stage as if we had captured them under OLAT lighting. Furthermore, we can fit our model to unseen subjects from as little as a single image, allowing several applications in novel view synthesis and relighting for digital avatars."}

However, unlike biological evolution, most LLM-evolution frameworks are formulated as static optimization problems, overlooking the open-ended adversarial dynamics that characterize real-world evolutionary processes. Here, we study Digital Red Queen (DRQ), a simple self-play algorithm that embraces these so-called \"Red Queen\" dynamics via continual adaptation to a changing objective. DRQ uses an LLM to evolve assembly-like programs, called warriors, which compete against each other for control of a virtual machine in the game of Core War, a Turing-complete environment studied in artificial life and connected to cybersecurity. In each round of DRQ, the model evolves a new warrior to defeat all previous ones, producing a sequence of adapted warriors. Over many rounds, we observe that warriors become increasingly general (relative to a set of held-out human warriors). Interestingly, warriors also become less behaviorally diverse across independent runs, indicating a convergence pressure toward a general-purpose behavioral strategy, much like convergent evolution in nature. This result highlights a potential value of shifting from static objectives to dynamic Red Queen objectives. Our work positions Core War as a rich, controllable sandbox for studying adversarial adaptation in artificial systems and for evaluating LLM-based evolution methods. More broadly, the simplicity and effectiveness of DRQ suggest that similarly minimal self-play approaches could prove useful in other more practical multi-agent adversarial domains, like real-world cybersecurity or combating drug resistance."}

Our results reveal the structural limits of internal reasoning: it causes performance collapse in weak models (the Prioritization Paradox) and leaves an 11.4\\% final output gap in frontier models. In contrast, RCA structurally eliminates sycophancy (0.0\\%) across all tiers. We synthesize these findings into a thermodynamic hierarchy: hybrid systems achieve Resonance (optimal efficiency) only when capabilities are matched and strong, while weak or mismatched pairs succumb to Dissonance and Entropy. This confirms that external structural constraints are strictly necessary to guarantee safety."}

However, as the number of erased concepts grows, these methods often become inefficient and ineffective, since each concept requires a separate set of fine-tuned parameters and may degrade the overall generation quality. In this work, we propose a supertype-subtype concept hierarchy that organizes erased concepts into a parent-child structure. Each erased concept is treated as a child node, and semantically related concepts (e.g., macaw, and bald eagle) are grouped under a shared parent node, referred to as a supertype concept (e.g., bird). Rather than erasing concepts individually, we introduce an effective and efficient group-wise suppression method, where semantically similar concepts are grouped and erased jointly by sharing a single set of learnable parameters. During the erasure phase, standard diffusion regularization is applied to preserve denoising process in unmasked regions. To mitigate the degradation of supertype generation caused by excessive erasure of semantically related subtypes, we propose a novel method called Supertype-Preserving Low-Rank Adaptation (SuPLoRA), which encodes the supertype concept information in the frozen down-projection matrix and updates only the up-projection matrix during erasure. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of SuPLoRA in mitigating generation performance degradation. We construct a more challenging benchmark that requires simultaneous erasure of concepts across diverse domains, including celebrities, objects, and pornographic content."}

This paper revisits a fundamental yet seldom systematically studied question: how VLM choice and competence translate to downstream VLA policies performance? We introduce VLM4VLA, a minimal adaptation pipeline that converts general-purpose VLMs into VLA policies using only a small set of new learnable parameters for fair and efficient comparison. Despite its simplicity, VLM4VLA proves surprisingly competitive with more sophisticated network designs. Through extensive empirical studies on various downstream tasks across three benchmarks, we find that while VLM initialization offers a consistent benefit over training from scratch, a VLM's general capabilities are poor predictors of its downstream task performance. This challenges common assumptions, indicating that standard VLM competence is necessary but insufficient for effective embodied control. We further investigate the impact of specific embodied capabilities by fine-tuning VLMs on seven auxiliary embodied tasks (e.g., embodied QA, visual pointing, depth estimation). Contrary to intuition, improving a VLM's performance on specific embodied skills does not guarantee better downstream control performance. Finally, modality-level ablations identify the visual module in VLM, rather than the language component, as the primary performance bottleneck. We demonstrate that injecting control-relevant supervision into the vision encoder of the VLM yields consistent gains, even when the encoder remains frozen during downstream fine-tuning. This isolates a persistent domain gap between current VLM pretraining objectives and the requirements of embodied action-planning."}

Open-source alternatives allow local inference but often require large model sizes that limit their use in resource-constrained clinical settings. Here, we benchmark two on-device LLMs, gpt-oss-20b and gpt-oss-120b, across three representative clinical tasks: general disease diagnosis, specialty-specific (ophthalmology) diagnosis and management, and simulation of human expert grading and evaluation. We compare their performance with state-of-the-art proprietary models (GPT-5 and o4-mini) and a leading open-source model (DeepSeek-R1), and we further evaluate the adaptability of on-device systems by fine-tuning gpt-oss-20b on general diagnostic data. Across tasks, gpt-oss models achieve performance comparable to or exceeding DeepSeek-R1 and o4-mini despite being substantially smaller. In addition, fine-tuning remarkably improves the diagnostic accuracy of gpt-oss-20b, enabling it to approach the performance of GPT-5. These findings highlight the potential of on-device LLMs to deliver accurate, adaptable, and privacy-preserving clinical decision support, offering a practical pathway for broader integration of LLMs into routine clinical practice."}

To address this fundamental bottleneck, we propose a flexible-duplex cell-free (CF) architecture in which each distributed access point (AP) can dynamically operate either as a receive AP for UAV uplink collection or as a transmit AP that generates cooperative artificial noise (AN) for secrecy enhancement. Such AP-level duplex flexibility introduces an additional spatial degree of freedom that enables distributed and adaptive protection against wiretapping in LAWNs. Building upon this architecture, we formulate a max-min secrecy-rate problem that jointly optimizes AP mode selection, receive combining, and AN covariance design. This tightly coupled and nonconvex optimization is tackled by first deriving the optimal receive combiners in closed form, followed by developing a penalty dual decomposition (PDD) algorithm with guaranteed convergence to a stationary solution. To further reduce computational burden, we propose a low-complexity sequential scheme that determines AP modes via a heuristic metric and then updates the AN covariance matrices through closed-form iterations embedded in the PDD framework. Simulation results show that the proposed flexible-duplex architecture yields substantial secrecy-rate gains over CF systems with fixed AP roles. The joint optimization method attains the highest secrecy performance, while the low-complexity approach achieves over 90% of the optimal performance with an order-of-magnitude lower computational complexity, offering a practical solution for secure uplink communications in LAWNs."}

As consumer demand for high-quality aquatic products rises, freshness and appearance integrity are key concerns. In shrimp-based processed foods, freshness declines rapidly post-harvest, and soft-shell shrimp often suffer from head-body separation after cooking or freezing, affecting product appearance and consumer perception. To address these issues, this study leverages deep learning-based image recognition for automated classification of white shrimp immediately after harvest. A convolutional neural network (CNN) model replaces manual sorting, enhancing classification accuracy, efficiency, and consistency. By reducing processing time, this technology helps maintain freshness and ensures that shrimp transportation businesses meet customer demands more effectively."}

smart and fast model that answers most questions, a deeper reasoning model for harder problems, and a real-time router that quickly decides which model to use based on conversation type, complexity, tool needs, and explicit intent (for example, if you say 'think hard about this' in the prompt). The router is continuously trained on real signals, including when users switch models, preference rates for responses, and measured correctness, improving over time. Once usage limits are reached, a mini version of each model handles remaining queries.\n  This system card focuses primarily on gpt-5-thinking and gpt-5-main, while evaluations for other models are available in the appendix. The GPT-5 system not only outperforms previous models on benchmarks and answers questions more quickly, but -- more importantly -- is more useful for real-world queries. We've made significant advances in reducing hallucinations, improving instruction following, and minimizing sycophancy, and have leveled up GPT-5's performance in three of ChatGPT's most common uses: writing, coding, and health. All of the GPT-5 models additionally feature safe-completions, our latest approach to safety training to prevent disallowed content.\n  Similarly to ChatGPT agent, we have decided to treat gpt-5-thinking as High capability in the Biological and Chemical domain under our Preparedness Framework, activating the associated safeguards. While we do not have definitive evidence that this model could meaningfully help a novice to create severe biological harm -- our defined threshold for High capability -- we have chosen to take a precautionary approach."}

Previous approaches, such as rule-based systems, face significant limitations, including poor interpretability, inconsistent adherence to guidelines, and narrow domain applicability. To address this, we develop and validate CPGPrompt, an auto-prompting system that converts narrative clinical guidelines into large language models (LLMs).\n  Our framework translates CPGs into structured decision trees and utilizes an LLM to dynamically navigate them for patient case evaluation. Synthetic vignettes were generated across three domains (headache, lower back pain, and prostate cancer) and distributed into four categories to test different decision scenarios. System performance was assessed on both binary specialty-referral decisions and fine-grained pathway-classification tasks.\n  The binary specialty referral classification achieved consistently strong performance across all domains (F1: 0.85-1.00), with high recall (1.00 $\\pm$ 0.00). In contrast, multi-class pathway assignment showed reduced performance, with domain-specific variations: headache (F1: 0.47), lower back pain (F1: 0.72), and prostate cancer (F1: 0.77). Domain-specific performance differences reflected the structure of each guideline. The headache guideline highlighted challenges with negation handling. The lower back pain guideline required temporal reasoning. In contrast, prostate cancer pathways benefited from quantifiable laboratory tests, resulting in more reliable decision-making."}

However, whether LFMs can provide truly personalized treatment recommendations remains an open question. Recent research has revealed multiple challenges for personalization, including the fundamental generalizability paradox: models achieving high accuracy in one clinical study perform at chance level in others, demonstrating that personalization and external validity exist in tension. This exemplifies broader contradictions in AI-driven healthcare: the privacy-performance paradox, scale-specificity paradox, and the automation-empathy paradox. As another challenge, the degree of causal understanding required for personalized recommendations, as opposed to mere predictive capacities of LFMs, remains an open question. N-of-1 trials -- crossover self-experiments and the gold standard for individual causal inference in personalized medicine -- resolve these tensions by providing within-person causal evidence while preserving privacy through local experimentation. Despite their impressive capabilities, this paper argues that LFMs cannot replace N-of-1 trials. We argue that LFMs and N-of-1 trials are complementary: LFMs excel at rapid hypothesis generation from population patterns using multimodal data, while N-of-1 trials excel at causal validation for a given individual. We propose a hybrid framework that combines the strengths of both to enable personalization and navigate the identified paradoxes: LFMs generate ranked intervention candidates with uncertainty estimates, which trigger subsequent N-of-1 trials. Clarifying the boundary between prediction and causation and explicitly addressing the paradoxical tensions are essential for responsible AI integration in personalized medicine."}

Furthermore, scalable GF-CF-MaMIMO networks inherently rely on distributed signal processing. In this work, we consider the uplink of a GF-CF-MaMIMO system and propose two novel distributed algorithms for joint activity detection, channel estimation, and data detection (JACD) based on expectation propagation (EP). The first algorithm, denoted as JACD-EP, uses Gaussian approximations for the channel variables, whereas the second, referred to as JACD-EP-BG, models them as Bernoulli-Gaussian (BG) random variables. To integrate the BG distribution into the EP framework, we derive its exponential family representation and develop the two algorithms as efficient message passing over a factor graph constructed from the a posteriori probability (APP) distribution. The proposed framework is inherently scalable with respect to both the number of access points (APs) and user equipments (UEs). Simulation results show the efficient mitigation of PC by the proposed distributed algorithms and their superior detection accuracy compared to (genie-aided) centralized linear detectors."}

A major challenge is to relight the avatars to match any scene illumination. For high quality relighting, existing methods require subjects to be captured under complex time-multiplexed illumination, such as one-light-at-a-time (OLAT). We propose a new generalized relightable 3D Gaussian head model that can relight any subject observed in a single- or multi-view images without requiring OLAT data for that subject. Our core idea is to learn a mapping from flat-lit 3DGS avatars to corresponding relightable Gaussian parameters for that avatar. Our model consists of two stages: a first stage that models flat-lit 3DGS avatars without OLAT lighting, and a second stage that learns the mapping to physically-based reflectance parameters for high-quality relighting. This two-stage design allows us to train the first stage across diverse existing multi-view datasets without OLAT lighting ensuring cross-subject generalization, where we learn a dataset-specific lighting code for self-supervised lighting alignment. Subsequently, the second stage can be trained on a significantly smaller dataset of subjects captured under OLAT illumination. Together, this allows our method to generalize well and relight any subject from the first stage as if we had captured them under OLAT lighting. Furthermore, we can fit our model to unseen subjects from as little as a single image, allowing several applications in novel view synthesis and relighting for digital avatars."}

In practical situations on inference tasks, the model's parameters have uncertainty because they are often learned from data, and thus we want to compute the degree of uncertainty in the inference outcome. One possible approach is to regard the inference outcome as a random variable by introducing distributions for the parameters and evaluate the variance of the outcome. Unfortunately, the tractability of computing such a variance is hardly known. Motivated by this, we consider the problem of computing the variance of WMC and investigate this problem's tractability. First, we derive a polynomial time algorithm to evaluate the WMC variance when the input is given as a structured d-DNNF. Second, we prove the hardness of this problem for structured DNNFs, d-DNNFs, and FBDDs, which is intriguing because the latter two allow polynomial time WMC algorithms. Finally, we show an application that measures the uncertainty in the inference of Bayesian networks. We empirically show that our algorithm can evaluate the variance of the marginal probability on real-world Bayesian networks and analyze the impact of the variances of parameters on the variance of the marginal."}

Specifically, we first propose a novel data curation pipeline that leverages image matting datasets for training and design a depth fixer network to automatically identify soft boundary regions. With a gated residual module, the depth fixer refines depth precisely around soft boundaries while maintaining global depth quality, allowing plug-and-play integration with state-of-the-art depth models. For view synthesis, we perform depth-based forward warping to retain high-fidelity textures, followed by a generative scene painter that fills disoccluded regions and eliminates redundant background artifacts within soft boundaries. Finally, a color fuser adaptively combines warped and inpainted results to produce novel views with consistent geometry and fine-grained details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HairGuard achieves state-of-the-art performance across monocular depth estimation, stereo image/video conversion, and novel view synthesis, with significant improvements in soft boundary regions."}

While existing LLMs can detect harmful or unsafe content, they often struggle with nuanced cases such as implicit offensiveness, subtle gender and racial biases, and jailbreak prompts, due to the subjective and context-dependent nature of these issues. Furthermore, their heavy reliance on training data can reinforce societal biases, resulting in inconsistent and ethically problematic outputs. To address these challenges, we introduce GuardEval, a unified multi-perspective benchmark dataset designed for both training and evaluation, containing 106 fine-grained categories spanning human emotions, offensive and hateful language, gender and racial bias, and broader safety concerns. We also present GemmaGuard (GGuard), a QLoRA fine-tuned version of Gemma3-12B trained on GuardEval, to assess content moderation with fine-grained labels. Our evaluation shows that GGuard achieves a macro F1 score of 0.832, substantially outperforming leading moderation models, including OpenAI Moderator (0.64) and Llama Guard (0.61). We show that multi-perspective, human-centered safety benchmarks are critical for reducing biased and inconsistent moderation decisions.

In this work, we introduce SCRIBE (Skill-Conditioned Reward with Intermediate Behavioral Evaluation), a reinforcement learning framework that intervenes at a novel mid-level abstraction. SCRIBE grounds reward modeling in a curated library of skill prototypes, transforming open-ended LLM evaluation into a constrained verification problem. By routing each subgoal to a corresponding prototype, the reward model is equipped with precise, structured rubrics that substantially reduce reward variance.\n  Experimental results show that SCRIBE achieves state-of-the-art performance across a range of reasoning and tool-use benchmarks. In particular, it improves the AIME25 accuracy of a Qwen3-4B model from 43.3% to 63.3%, and significantly increases success rates in complex multi-turn tool interactions.\n  Further analysis of training dynamics reveals a co-evolution across abstraction levels, where mastery of mid-level skills consistently precedes the emergence of effective high-level planning behaviors.

The primate world is dynamic, and the macaque ventral visual pathways, specifically the inferior temporal (IT) cortex not only supports object recognition but also encodes object motion velocity during naturalistic video viewing. Does IT's temporal responses reflect nothing more than time-unfolded feedforward transformations, framewise features with shallow temporal pooling, or do they embody richer dynamic computations? We tested this by comparing macaque IT responses during naturalistic videos against static, recurrent, and video-based ANN models. Video models provided modest improvements in neural predictivity, particularly at later response stages, raising the question of what kind of dynamics they capture. To probe this, we applied a stress test: decoders trained on naturalistic videos were evaluated on \"appearance-free\" variants that preserve motion but remove shape and texture. IT population activity generalized across this manipulation, but all ANN classes failed. Thus, current video models better capture appearance-bound dynamics rather than the appearance-invariant temporal computations expressed in IT, underscoring the need for new objectives that encode biological temporal statistics and invariances."}

To make reasoning more reliable and flexible, it is important to develop methods for controlling reasoning strategies. Existing methods struggle to control fine-grained reasoning strategies due to conceptual entanglement in LRMs' hidden states. To address this, we leverage Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to decompose strategy-entangled hidden states into a disentangled feature space. To identify the few strategy-specific features from the vast pool of SAE features, we propose SAE-Steering, an efficient two-stage feature identification pipeline. SAE-Steering first recalls features that amplify the logits of strategy-specific keywords, filtering out over 99\\% of features, and then ranks the remaining features by their control effectiveness.

This leads to them underperforming on reasoning models (Models with Chain-of-Thoughts) compared to non-reasoning ones (Models without Chain-of-Thoughts).

We then empirically investigate how byte--pair encoding (BPE) transforms corpus statistics, showing that recursive applications of BPE drive token frequencies toward a Zipfian power law while inducing a characteristic growth pattern in empirical entropy. Utilizing the ability of transformers to learn context dependent token probability distributions, we train language models on corpora tokenised at varying BPE depths, revealing that the model predictive entropies increasingly agree with Zipf-derived predictions as the BPE depth increases. Attention-based diagnostics further indicate that deeper tokenisation reduces local token dependencies, bringing the empirical distribution closer to the weakly dependent (near IID) regime.

This paper presents an approach for architecting such systems using design patterns derived from enterprise distributed systems standards, formal methods, and industry practice. We classify these patterns into three tiers: LLM Agents (task-specific automation), Agentic AI (adaptive goal-seekers), and Agentic Communities (organizational frameworks where AI agents and human participants coordinate through formal roles, protocols, and governance structures). We focus on Agentic Communities - coordination frameworks encompassing LLM Agents, Agentic AI entities, and humans - most relevant for enterprise and industrial applications. Drawing on established coordination principles from distributed systems, we ground these patterns in a formal framework that specifies collaboration agreements where AI agents and humans fill roles within governed ecosystems. This approach provides both practical guidance and formal verification capabilities, enabling expression of organizational, legal, and ethical rules through accountability mechanisms that ensure operational and verifiable governance of inter-agent communication, negotiation, and intent modeling. We validate this framework through a clinical trial matching case study. Our goal is to provide actionable guidance to practitioners while maintaining the formal rigor essential for enterprise deployment in dynamic, multi-agent ecosystems."}

In this work, we investigate the problem in the scope of the emergent misalignment problem where LLMs can generalize patterns learned from misaligned content in one domain to another domain. We discover a strong causal relationship between metaphors in training data and the misalignment degree of LLMs' reasoning contents. With interventions using metaphors in pre-training, fine-tuning and re-alignment phases, models' cross-domain misalignment degrees change significantly. As we delve deeper into the causes behind this phenomenon, we observe that there is a connection between metaphors and the activation of global and local latent features of large reasoning models. By monitoring these latent features, we design a detector that predict misaligned content with high accuracy."}

The common practice of fully fine-tuning the vision encoder on driving datasets potentially limits its generalization by causing the model to specialize too heavily in the training data. This work challenges the necessity of this training paradigm. We propose FROST-Drive, a novel E2E architecture designed to preserve and leverage the powerful generalization capabilities of a pretrained vision encoder from a Vision-Language Model (VLM). By keeping the encoder's weights frozen, our approach directly transfers the rich, generalized world knowledge from the VLM to the driving task. Our model architecture combines this frozen encoder with a transformer-based adapter for multimodal fusion and a GRU-based decoder for smooth waypoint generation. Furthermore, we introduce a custom loss function designed to directly optimize for Rater Feedback Score (RFS), a metric that prioritizes robust trajectory planning. We conduct extensive experiments on Waymo Open E2E Dataset, a large-scale datasets deliberately curated to capture the long-tail scenarios, demonstrating that our frozen-encoder approach significantly outperforms models that employ full fine-tuning. Our results provide substantial evidence that preserving the broad knowledge of a capable VLM is a more effective strategy for achieving robust, generalizable driving performance than intensive domain-specific adaptation. This offers a new pathway for developing vision-based models that can better handle the complexities of real-world application domains."}

While such tendencies suit instruction-following systems, they suppress dramatic tension and yield predictable characters, stemming from maximum likelihood training and assistant fine-tuning. To address this, we introduce PersonaWeaver, a framework that disentangles world-building (roles, demographics) from behavioral-building (moral stances, interactional styles), yielding characters with more diverse reactions and moral stances, as well as second-order diversity in stylistic markers like length, tone, and punctuation.

Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning improves accuracy but incurs prohibitive latency for real-time query correction. A potential solution is to output an answer before reasoning to reduce latency; however, under autoregressive decoding, the early answer is independent of subsequent reasoning, preventing the model from leveraging its reasoning capability to improve accuracy. To address this issue, we propose Sandwich Reasoning (SandwichR), a novel approach that explicitly aligns a fast initial answer with post-hoc reasoning, enabling low-latency query correction without sacrificing reasoning-aware accuracy. SandwichR follows an Answer-Reasoning-Answer paradigm, producing an initial correction, an explicit reasoning process, and a final refined correction. To align the initial answer with post-reasoning insights, we design a consistency-aware reinforcement learning (RL) strategy: a dedicated consistency reward enforces alignment between the initial and final corrections, while margin-based rejection sampling prioritizes borderline samples where reasoning drives the most impactful corrective gains. Additionally, we construct a high-quality query correction dataset, addressing the lack of specialized benchmarks for complex query correction. Experimental results demonstrate that SandwichR achieves SOTA accuracy comparable to standard CoT while delivering a 40-70% latency reduction, resolving the latency-accuracy trade-off in online search."}

Through layer-wise analysis, we find that fine-tuning on such protected data induces persistent activation of alignment-related layers, causing alignment constraints to override task learning even on common inputs. Consequently, models trained on such data exhibit substantial and systematic performance degradation compared to standard fine-tuning. Our results identify alignment behaviour as a previously unexplored lever for data protection and, to our knowledge, present the first practical method for restricting data learnability at LLM scale without requiring access to or modification of the training pipeline."}

Previous work successfully demonstrated that automated planners, using general domain-independent heuristics, are able to generate personalized treatments, when the domain and problems are modeled using a general domain description language (\\pddlp). Unfortunately, this process was limited in practice to consider no more than seven medications. In clinical terms, this is a non-starter. In this paper, we explore the use of automatically-generated domain- and problem-specific heuristics to be used with general search, as a method of scaling up medication planning to levels allowing closer work with clinicians. Specifically, we specify the domain programmatically (specifying an initial state and a successor generation procedure), and use an LLM to generate a problem specific heuristic that can be used by a fixed search algorithm (GBFS). The results indicate dramatic improvements in coverage and planning time, scaling up the number of medications to at least 28, and bringing medication planning one step closer to practical applications."}

In this work, we propose ThinkRL-Edit, a reasoning-centric RL framework that decouples visual reasoning from image synthesis and expands reasoning exploration beyond denoising. To the end, we introduce Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-based reasoning sampling with planning and reflection stages prior to generation in online sampling, compelling the model to explore multiple semantic hypotheses and validate their plausibility before committing to a visual outcome. To avoid the failures of weighted aggregation, we propose an unbiased chain preference grouping strategy across multiple reward dimensions. Moreover, we replace interval-based VLM scores with a binary checklist, yielding more precise, lower-variance, and interpretable rewards for complex reasoning.

We propose LatentGraphMem, a memory framework that combines implicit graph memory with explicit subgraph retrieval. LatentGraphMem stores a graph-structured memory in latent space for stability and efficiency, and exposes a task-specific subgraph retrieval interface that returns a compact symbolic subgraph under a fixed budget for downstream reasoning and human inspection. During training, an explicit graph view is materialized to interface with a frozen reasoner for question-answering supervision. At inference time, retrieval is performed in latent space and only the retrieved subgraph is externalized.

In this work, we systematically analyze reward hacking behaviors in text-to-image (T2I) RL post-training. We investigate how both aesthetic/human preference rewards and prompt-image consistency rewards individually contribute to reward hacking and further show that ensembling multiple rewards can only partially mitigate this issue.

To address this, we introduce a training-free algorithm called Structure-Disrupted Contrastive Decoding (SDCD), which performs contrastive calibration of the output distribution by introducing a shuffled structure-disrupted view. By penalizing tokens that maintain high confidence under this structure-less view, SDCD effectively suppresses the texture-driven bias. Experimental results demonstrate that SDCD significantly mitigates hallucinations across multiple benchmarks and enhances the overall multimodal capabilities of LVLMs."}

These findings underscore the importance of explicitly accounting for aspects when measuring document similarity and highlight the need to revise standard practice. Next, we conducted a large-scale meta-evaluation using 16 smaller open-source LLMs and 9 embedding models with a focus on making ASPECTSIM accessible and reproducible. While directly prompting LLMs to produce ASPECTSIM scores turned out be ineffective (20-30% human-machine agreement), a simple two-stage refinement improved their agreement by $\\approx$140%.

Among other things, explainablility for deep neural networks has been a topic of intensive research due to the meteoric rise in prominence of deep neural networks and their \"black-box\" nature. xAI approaches can be characterized along different dimensions such as their scope (global versus local explanations) or underlying methodologies (statistic-based versus rule-based strategies). Methods generating global explanations aim to provide reasoning process applicable to all possible output classes while local explanation methods focus only on a single, specific class. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), a well-known statistical technique, identifies important features of a network. Deep neural network rule extraction method constructs IF-THEN rules that link input conditions to a class. Another approach focuses on generating counterfactuals which help explain how small changes to an input can affect the model's predictions. However, these techniques primarily focus on the input-output relationship and thus neglect the structure of the network in explanation generation.   In this work, we propose xDNN(ASP), an explanation generation system for deep neural networks that provides global explanations. Given a neural network model and its training data, xDNN(ASP) extracts a logic program under answer set semantics that-in the ideal case-represents the trained model, i.e., answer sets of the extracted program correspond one-to-one to input-output pairs of the network. We demonstrate experimentally, using two synthetic datasets, that not only the extracted logic program maintains a high-level of accuracy in the prediction task, but it also provides valuable information for the understanding of the model such as the importance of features as well as the impact of hidden nodes on the prediction.

Our G2P address the misalignment between optimized Gaussians and original point geometry by establishing point-wise correspondences.

While effective over short horizons this approach does not separate observation reconstruction with dynamics modeling and offers no explicit representation of the latent causes governing motion. As a result, existing methods exhibit compounding drift, mean-pose collapse, and poorly calibrated uncertainty when rolled forward beyond the training regime. Here we propose a Semantic Belief-State World Model (SBWM) that reframes human motion prediction as latent dynamical simulation on the human body manifold. Rather than predicting poses directly, SBWM maintains a recurrent probabilistic belief state whose evolution is learned independently of pose reconstruction and explicitly aligned with the SMPL-X anatomical parameterization. This alignment imposes a structural information bottleneck that prevents the latent state from encoding static geometry or sensor noise, forcing it to capture motion dynamics, intent, and control-relevant structure. Inspired by belief-state world models developed for model-based reinforcement learning, SBWM adapts stochastic latent transitions and rollout-centric training to the domain of human motion. In contrast to RSSM-based, transformer, and diffusion approaches optimized for reconstruction fidelity, SBWM prioritizes stable forward simulation. We demonstrate coherent long-horizon rollouts, and competitive accuracy at substantially lower computational cost. These results suggest that treating the human body as part of the world models state space rather than its output fundamentally changes how motion is simulated, and predicted."}

While zero-shot prompting performs near chance, linear probes improve average F1 from 0.15-0.26 to 0.61-0.67, often matching or exceeding specialized time series models. Layer-wise analyses further show that class-discriminative time series information emerges in early transformer layers and is amplified by visual and multimodal inputs. Together, these results demonstrate a systematic mismatch between what LLMs internally represent and what prompt-based evaluation reveals, leading current evaluations to underestimate their time series understanding."}

Across diverse agentic and visual question answering tasks, we observe that some agents rarely invoke simulation (fewer than 1%), frequently misuse predicted rollouts (approximately 15%), and often exhibit inconsistent or even degraded performance (up to 5%) when simulation is available or enforced. Attribution analysis further indicates that the primary bottleneck lies in the agents' capacity to decide when to simulate, how to interpret predicted outcomes, and how to integrate foresight into downstream reasoning. These findings underscore the need for mechanisms that foster calibrated, strategic interaction with world models, paving the way toward more reliable anticipatory cognition in future agent systems."}

However, existing methods typically compress optical features to match thermal feature dimensions for cross-modal alignment and fusion, which not only causes the loss of high-frequency information that is beneficial for thermal super-resolution, but also introduces physically inconsistent artifacts such as texture distortions and edge blurring by overlooking differences in the imaging physics between modalities. To address these challenges, we propose PCNet to achieve cross-resolution mutual enhancement between optical and thermal modalities, while physically constraining the optical guidance process via thermal conduction to enable robust thermal UAV image super-resolution. In particular, we design a Cross-Resolution Mutual Enhancement Module (CRME) to jointly optimize thermal image super-resolution and optical-to-thermal modality conversion, facilitating effective bidirectional feature interaction across resolutions while preserving high-frequency optical priors. Moreover, we propose a Physics-Driven Thermal Conduction Module (PDTM) that incorporates two-dimensional heat conduction into optical guidance, modeling spatially-varying heat conduction properties to prevent inconsistent artifacts. In addition, we introduce a temperature consistency loss that enforces regional distribution consistency and boundary gradient smoothness to ensure generated thermal images align with real-world thermal radiation principles. Extensive experiments on VGTSR2.0 and DroneVehicle datasets demonstrate that PCNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both reconstruction quality and downstream tasks including semantic segmentation and object detection."}

Our key innovation is a verification method that transforms the problem of evaluating reasoning over lengthy financial documents into a structured Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) task.

In this paper, we propose CloudMatch, a semi-supervised framework that effectively leverages unlabeled remote sensing imagery through view-consistency learning combined with scene-mixing augmentations. An observation behind CloudMatch is that cloud patterns exhibit structural diversity and contextual variability across different scenes and within the same scene category. Our key insight is that enforcing prediction consistency across diversely augmented views, incorporating both inter-scene and intra-scene mixing, enables the model to capture the structural diversity and contextual richness of cloud patterns. Specifically, CloudMatch generates one weakly augmented view along with two complementary strongly augmented views for each unlabeled image: one integrates inter-scene patches to simulate contextual variety, while the other employs intra-scene mixing to preserve semantic coherence. This approach guides pseudolabel generation and enhances generalization. Extensive experiments show that CloudMatch achieves good performance, demonstrating its capability to utilize unlabeled data efficiently and advance semi-supervised cloud detection."}

Despite its importance, the task remains challenging due to the complexity of defining topic boundaries, the variability in discourse structure, and the need to balance local coherence with global context. These difficulties hinder downstream applications such as summarization, information retrieval, and question answering. In this work, we introduce SegNSP, framing linear text segmentation as a next sentence prediction (NSP) task. Although NSP has largely been abandoned in modern pre-training, its explicit modeling of sentence-to-sentence continuity makes it a natural fit for detecting topic boundaries. We propose a label-agnostic NSP approach, which predicts whether the next sentence continues the current topic without requiring explicit topic labels, and enhance it with a segmentation-aware loss combined with harder negative sampling to better capture discourse continuity. Unlike recent proposals that leverage NSP alongside auxiliary topic classification, our approach avoids task-specific supervision. We evaluate our model against established baselines on two datasets, CitiLink-Minutes, for which we establish the first segmentation benchmark, and WikiSection. On CitiLink-Minutes, SegNSP achieves a B-$F_1$ of 0.79, closely aligning with human-annotated topic transitions, while on WikiSection it attains a B-F$_1$ of 0.65, outperforming the strongest reproducible baseline, TopSeg, by 0.17 absolute points.

Existing efficient reasoning methods relying on explicit length penalties often introduce optimization conflicts and leave the generative mechanisms driving overthinking largely unexamined. In this paper, we identify a phenomenon termed length shift where models increasingly generate unnecessary reasoning on trivial inputs during training. To address this, we introduce Dynamic Outlier Truncation (DOT), a training-time intervention that selectively suppresses redundant tokens. This method targets only the extreme tail of response lengths within fully correct rollout groups while preserving long-horizon reasoning capabilities for complex problems. To complement this intervention and ensure stable convergence, we further incorporate auxiliary KL regularization and predictive dynamic sampling. Experimental results across multiple model scales demonstrate that our approach significantly pushes the efficiency-performance Pareto frontier outward.

In this task, objects often recur across text and point clouds, making spatial relationships the most discriminative cues for localization. Given this characteristic, we present SpatiaLoc, a framework utilizing a coarse-to-fine strategy that emphasizes spatial relationships at both the instance and global levels. In the coarse stage, we introduce a Bezier Enhanced Object Spatial Encoder (BEOSE) that models spatial relationships at the instance level using quadratic Bezier curves. Additionally, a Frequency Aware Encoder (FAE) generates spatial representations in the frequency domain at the global level. In the fine stage, an Uncertainty Aware Gaussian Fine Localizer (UGFL) regresses 2D positions by modeling predictions as Gaussian distributions with a loss function aware of uncertainty.

However, most existing approaches treat culture as static background knowledge, overlooking its dynamic and evolving nature. This limitation reduces their reliability in downstream tasks that demand genuine cultural sensitivity. In this work, we introduce CALM, a novel framework designed to endow language models with cultural self-awareness. CALM disentangles task semantics from explicit cultural concepts and latent cultural signals, shaping them into structured cultural clusters through contrastive learning. These clusters are then aligned via cross-attention to establish fine-grained interactions among related cultural features and are adaptively integrated through a Mixture-of-Experts mechanism along culture-specific dimensions. The resulting unified representation is fused with the model's original knowledge to construct a culturally grounded internal identity state, which is further enhanced through self-prompted reflective learning, enabling continual adaptation and self-correction. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple cross-cultural benchmark datasets demonstrate that CALM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods."}

Detecting AI-generated images has thus become a critical challenge, particularly in terms of generalizing to unseen generative models. Existing methods using frozen pre-trained CLIP models show promise in generalization but treat the image encoder as a basic feature extractor, failing to fully exploit its potential. In this paper, we perform an in-depth analysis of the frozen CLIP image encoder (CLIP-ViT), revealing that it effectively clusters real images in a high-level, abstract feature space. However, it does not truly possess the ability to distinguish between real and AI-generated images. Based on this analysis, we propose a Masking-based Pre-trained model Fine-Tuning (MPFT) strategy, which introduces a Texture-Aware Masking (TAM) mechanism to mask textured areas containing generative model-specific patterns during fine-tuning. This approach compels CLIP-ViT to attend to the \"distributional deviations\"from authentic images for AI-generated image detection, thereby achieving enhanced generalization performance. Extensive experiments on the GenImage and UniversalFakeDetect datasets demonstrate that our method, fine-tuned with only a minimal number of images, significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving up to 98.2% and 94.6% average accuracy on the two datasets, respectively."}

We present a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding drift phenomena, proposing three distinct manifestations: semantic drift (progressive deviation from original intent), coordination drift (breakdown in multi-agent consensus mechanisms), and behavioral drift (emergence of unintended strategies).\n  We introduce the Agent Stability Index (ASI), a novel composite metric framework for quantifying drift across twelve dimensions, including response consistency, tool usage patterns, reasoning pathway stability, and inter-agent agreement rates. Through simulation-based analysis and theoretical modeling, we demonstrate how unchecked agent drift can lead to substantial reductions in task completion accuracy and increased human intervention requirements.\n  We propose three mitigation strategies: episodic memory consolidation, drift-aware routing protocols, and adaptive behavioral anchoring. Theoretical analysis suggests these approaches can significantly reduce drift-related errors while maintaining system throughput. This work establishes a foundational methodology for monitoring, measuring, and mitigating agent drift in production agentic AI systems, with direct implications for enterprise deployment reliability and AI safety research."}

Inspired by this question, we introduce SiT-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the SI performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) without pixel-level input, comprises over 3,800 expert-annotated items across five primary categories and 17 subtasks, ranging from egocentric navigation and perspective transformation to fine-grained robotic manipulation.

Evaluation results of state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs reveals that while models achieve proficiency in localized semantic tasks, a significant \"spatial gap\" remains in global consistency. Notably, we find that explicit spatial reasoning significantly boosts performance, suggesting that LLMs possess latent world-modeling potential.

KR-Test utilizes automatically generated contrastive examples to measure likelihood preferences for correct versus incorrect continuations, requiring no instruction tuning or generative decoding. We validate the framework's integrity through a \"blind vs. oracle\" baseline analysis.

However, existing studies largely overlook the complex environmental factors encountered in real world scenarios-such as illumination, background, and camera viewpoint-which can substantially increase the difficulty of test images. As a result, models trained under laboratory conditions often fall short of practical deployment requirements. To bridge this gap, in this paper, an environment-robust FSS setting is introduced that explicitly incorporates challenging test cases arising from complex environments-such as motion blur, small objects, and camouflaged targets-to enhance model's robustness under realistic, dynamic conditions. An environment robust FSS benchmark (ER-FSS) is established, covering eight datasets across multiple real world scenarios. In addition, an Adaptive Attention Distillation (AAD) method is proposed, which repeatedly contrasts and distills key shared semantics between known (support) and unknown (query) images to derive class-specific attention for novel categories. This strengthens the model's ability to focus on the correct targets in complex environments, thereby improving environmental robustness. Comparative experiments show that AAD improves mIoU by 3.3% - 8.5% across all datasets and settings, demonstrating superior performance and strong generalization.

Existing speed-up approaches typically rely on retraining the model or designing sophisticated prompting, which are either prohibitively expensive or highly sensitive to the input and prompt formulation. In this work, we study model merging as a lightweight alternative for efficient reasoning: by combining a long chain-of-thought (Long-CoT) reasoning model with a Short-CoT instruction model, we obtain an adaptive reasoner without training from scratch or requiring large-scale additional data. Building on this idea, we propose Reasoning Pattern Alignment Merging (RPAM), a layer-wise model merging framework based on feature alignment to facilitate query-adaptive reasoning. RPAM first constructs a small pattern-labeled calibration set that assigns each query an appropriate reasoning pattern. It then optimizes layer-wise merging coefficients by aligning the merged model's intermediate representations with those of the selected model, while a contrastive objective explicitly pushes them away from the non-selected model. Experiments on seven widely used reasoning benchmarks show that RPAM substantially reduces inference cost while maintaining strong performance. Upon article acceptance, we will provide open-source code to reproduce experiments for RPAM."}

Using CAP-GSM8K (N=500), an adversarial dataset, we evaluate internal (CoT) versus external (RCA) mechanisms across GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, and GPT-5.1. Our results reveal the structural limits of internal reasoning: it causes performance collapse in weak models (the Prioritization Paradox) and leaves an 11.4\\% final output gap in frontier models. In contrast, RCA structurally eliminates sycophancy (0.0\\%) across all tiers. We synthesize these findings into a thermodynamic hierarchy: hybrid systems achieve Resonance (optimal efficiency) only when capabilities are matched and strong, while weak or mismatched pairs succumb to Dissonance and Entropy. This confirms that external structural constraints are strictly necessary to guarantee safety."}

Stone inscription images pose severe challenges for binarization due to poor contrast between etched characters and the stone background, non-uniform surface degradation, distracting artifacts, and highly variable text density and layouts. These conditions frequently cause existing binarization techniques to fail and struggle to isolate coherent character regions. Many approaches sub-divide the image into patches to improve text fragment resolution and improve binarization performance. With this in mind, we present a robust and adaptive patching strategy to binarize challenging Indic inscriptions. The patches from our approach are used to train an Attention U-Net for binarization. The attention mechanism allows the model to focus on subtle structural cues, while our dynamic sampling and patch selection method ensures that the model learns to overcome surface noise and layout irregularities. We also introduce a carefully annotated, pixel-precise dataset of Indic stone inscriptions at the character-fragment level. We demonstrate that our novel patching mechanism significantly boosts binarization performance across classical and deep learning baselines. Despite training only on single script Indic dataset, our model exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to other Indic and non-indic scripts, highlighting its robustness and script-agnostic generalization capabilities. By producing clean, structured representations of inscription content, our method lays the foundation for downstream tasks such as script identification, OCR, and historical text analysis.

We propose IntroLM, a method that enables causal language models to predict their own output quality during the prefilling phase without affecting generation using introspective tokens. By introducing token conditional LoRA that activates only for the introspective token, the model learns to predict the output quality for a given query while preserving the original backbone behavior and avoiding external evaluators. On question answering benchmarks, IntroLM applied to Qwen3 8B achieves a ROC AUC of 90 precent for success prediction, outperforming a DeBERTa classifier by 14 precent. When integrated into multi model routing systems, IntroLM achieves superior cost performance tradeoffs, reducing latency by up to 33 precent and large model usage by up to 50 precent at matched reliability."}

We compare their performance with state-of-the-art proprietary models (GPT-5 and o4-mini) and a leading open-source model (DeepSeek-R1), and we further evaluate the adaptability of on-device systems by fine-tuning gpt-oss-20b on general diagnostic data. Across tasks, gpt-oss models achieve performance comparable to or exceeding DeepSeek-R1 and o4-mini despite being substantially smaller. In addition, fine-tuning remarkably improves the diagnostic accuracy of gpt-oss-20b, enabling it to approach the performance of GPT-5.

NeWCRFs yields stronger downstream 3D detection, achieving 10.50\\% AP$_{3D}$ at IoU$=0.7$ on the Moderate split using grayscale intensity (Exp~2). We further test point-cloud augmentations using appearance cues (grayscale intensity) and semantic cues (instance segmentation confidence).

Finally, we report a depth-accuracy-versus-distance diagnostic using ground-truth 2D boxes (including Ped/Cyc), highlighting that coarse depth correctness does not fully predict strict 3D IoU.

smart and fast model that answers most questions, a deeper reasoning model for harder problems, and a real-time router that quickly decides which model to use based on conversation type, complexity, tool needs, and explicit intent (for example, if you say 'think hard about this' in the prompt). The router is continuously trained on real signals, including when users switch models, preference rates for responses, and measured correctness, improving over time. Once usage limits are reached, a mini version of each model handles remaining queries.\n  This system card focuses primarily on gpt-5-thinking and gpt-5-main, while evaluations for other models are available in the appendix. The GPT-5 system not only outperforms previous models on benchmarks and answers questions more quickly, but -- more importantly -- is more useful for real-world queries. We've made significant advances in reducing hallucinations, improving instruction following, and minimizing sycophancy, and have leveled up GPT-5's performance in three of ChatGPT's most common uses: writing, coding, and health. All of the GPT-5 models additionally feature safe-completions, our latest approach to safety training to prevent disallowed content.\n  Similarly to ChatGPT agent, we have decided to treat gpt-5-thinking as High capability in the Biological and Chemical domain under our Preparedness Framework, activating the associated safeguards. While we do not have definitive evidence that this model could meaningfully help a novice to create severe biological harm -- our defined threshold for High capability -- we have chosen to take a precautionary approach."}

In contrast, human conditions their interpretation and decision-making on each individual's personal context. To bridge this gap, we formalize the task of Personalized LALMs (PALM) for recognizing personal concepts and reasoning within personal context. Moreover, we create the first benchmark (PALM-Bench) to foster the methodological advances in PALM and enable structured evaluation on several tasks across multi-speaker scenarios. Our extensive experiments on representative open-source LALMs, show that existing training-free prompting and supervised fine-tuning strategies, while yield improvements, remains limited in modeling personalized knowledge and transferring them across tasks robustly.

Key difficulties include modeling complex multi-scale evolution, correcting inter-frame feature misalignment caused by displacement, and efficiently capturing long-range spatiotemporal context without sacrificing spatial fidelity. To address these issues, we present the Multi-scale Feature Communication Rectified Flow (RF) Network (MFC-RFNet), a generative framework that integrates multi-scale communication with guided feature fusion. To enhance multi-scale fusion while retaining fine detail, a Wavelet-Guided Skip Connection (WGSC) preserves high-frequency components, and a Feature Communication Module (FCM) promotes bidirectional cross-scale interaction. To correct inter-frame displacement, a Condition-Guided Spatial Transform Fusion (CGSTF) learns spatial transforms from conditioning echoes to align shallow features. The backbone adopts rectified flow training to learn near-linear probability-flow trajectories, enabling few-step sampling with stable fidelity. Additionally, lightweight Vision-RWKV (RWKV) blocks are placed at the encoder tail, the bottleneck, and the first decoder layer to capture long-range spatiotemporal dependencies at low spatial resolutions with moderate compute. Evaluations on four public datasets (SEVIR, MeteoNet, Shanghai, and CIKM) demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines, yielding clearer echo morphology at higher rain-rate thresholds and sustained skill at longer lead times. These results suggest that the proposed synergy of RF training with scale-aware communication, spatial alignment, and frequency-aware fusion presents an effective and robust approach for radar-based nowcasting."}

Yet existing perception-based bikeability assessment approaches face key limitations in capturing the complexity of road environments and adequately accounting for heterogeneity in subjective user perceptions. This paper proposes a persona-aware Vision-Language Model framework for bikeability assessment with three novel contributions: (i) theory-grounded persona conditioning based on established cyclist typology that generates persona-specific explanations via chain-of-thought reasoning; (ii) multi-granularity supervised fine-tuning that combines scarce expert-annotated reasoning with abundant user ratings for joint prediction and explainable assessment; and (iii) AI-enabled data augmentation that creates controlled paired data to isolate infrastructure variable impacts. To test and validate this framework, we developed a panoramic image-based crowdsourcing system and collected 12,400 persona-conditioned assessments from 427 cyclists.

This paper presents CrackSegFlow, a controllable flow-matching synthesis framework that generates photorealistic crack images conditioned on binary masks while preserving strict mask-image alignment. The generator combines topology-preserving mask injection with boundary-gated modulation to maintain thin-structure continuity and suppress texture-driven false positives. A second class-conditional flow-matching model synthesizes crack masks with explicit control over crack coverage, enabling balanced, topology-diverse paired data without additional manual annotation. We further inject crack masks into crack-free backgrounds to diversify illumination and surface artifacts and reduce false positives caused by shadows, joints, and pavement markings. Experiments on five benchmarks spanning four asphalt datasets and the crack class of a concrete-domain dataset demonstrate consistent improvements under an established hybrid CNN--Transformer segmentation backbone and a fixed training protocol. With real plus synthesized pairs, in-domain performance improves on average by 5.37 mIoU and 5.13 F1, and target-guided cross-domain synthesis yields average gains of 13.12 mIoU and 14.82 F1 using only limited target mask statistics. Compared with diffusion-based semantic synthesis, CrackSegFlow provides substantially faster deterministic sampling and improves fidelity and mask-image alignment for thin-structure crack geometry. Finally, we release CSF-50K, a public dataset of 50,000 paired crack images and pixel-accurate masks for large-scale benchmarking of generalizable crack segmentation."}

To bridge this gap, we introduce DeepSynth-Eval, a benchmark designed to objectively evaluate information consolidation capabilities. We leverage high-quality survey papers as gold standards, reverse-engineering research requests and constructing \"Oracle Contexts\" from their bibliographies to isolate synthesis from retrieval noise. We propose a fine-grained evaluation protocol using General Checklists (for factual coverage) and Constraint Checklists (for structural organization), transforming subjective judgment into verifiable metrics. Experiments across 96 tasks reveal that synthesizing information from hundreds of references remains a significant challenge. Our results demonstrate that agentic plan-and-write workflows significantly outperform single-turn generation, effectively reducing hallucinations and improving adherence to complex structural constraints."}

However, these benchmarks often suffer from significant semantic redundancy and impose high computational costs during evaluation. Existing compression methods, such as tinyBenchmarks depend critically on correctness labels from multiple historical models evaluated on the full test set, making them inapplicable in cold-start scenarios, such as the introduction of a new task, domain, or model with no prior evaluation history.\n  To address this limitation, we propose a history-free test set compression framework that requires no prior model performance data. Our method begins by fine-tuning a base LLM on a small amount of domain-specific data to internalize task-relevant semantics. It then generates high-level semantic embeddings for all original test samples using only their raw textual content. In this domain-adapted embedding space, we perform task-aware clustering and introduce a novel dataset X-ray mechanism that analyzes cluster geometry to dynamically calibrate the compression intensity based on the intrinsic redundancy of the benchmark.\n  Experiments on professional-domain dataset, notably a large-scale 3GPP communications benchmark, demonstrate that our approach effectively identifies and removes redundant samples, reducing evaluation cost by over 90% while preserving high fidelity to the full benchmark."}

Existing models can produce high-quality short clips but often fail to preserve entity identity and appearance when scenes change or when entities reappear after long temporal gaps. We present VideoMemory, an entity-centric framework that integrates narrative planning with visual generation through a Dynamic Memory Bank. Given a structured script, a multi-agent system decomposes the narrative into shots, retrieves entity representations from memory, and synthesizes keyframes and videos conditioned on these retrieved states. The Dynamic Memory Bank stores explicit visual and semantic descriptors for characters, props, and backgrounds, and is updated after each shot to reflect story-driven changes while preserving identity. This retrieval-update mechanism enables consistent portrayal of entities across distant shots and supports coherent long-form generation. To evaluate this setting, we construct a 54-case multi-shot consistency benchmark covering character-, prop-, and background-persistent scenarios. Extensive experiments show that VideoMemory achieves strong entity-level coherence and high perceptual quality across diverse narrative sequences."}

To explain this behavior, we propose a \\emph{probabilistic recall-and-extract} framework that models multi-hop reasoning as broad probabilistic recall in shallow MLP layers followed by selective extraction in deeper attention layers. This framework is empirically validated through systematic probing analyses, reinterpreting prior layer-wise decoding evidence, explaining chain-of-thought gains, and providing a mechanistic diagnosis of multi-hop failures despite correct single-hop knowledge.

While existing LLMs can detect harmful or unsafe content, they often struggle with nuanced cases such as implicit offensiveness, subtle gender and racial biases, and jailbreak prompts, due to the subjective and context-dependent nature of these issues. Furthermore, their heavy reliance on training data can reinforce societal biases, resulting in inconsistent and ethically problematic outputs. To address these challenges, we introduce GuardEval, a unified multi-perspective benchmark dataset designed for both training and evaluation, containing 106 fine-grained categories spanning human emotions, offensive and hateful language, gender and racial bias, and broader safety concerns. We also present GemmaGuard (GGuard), a QLoRA fine-tuned version of Gemma3-12B trained on GuardEval, to assess content moderation with fine-grained labels. Our evaluation shows that GGuard achieves a macro F1 score of 0.832, substantially outperforming leading moderation models, including OpenAI Moderator (0.64) and Llama Guard (0.61). We show that multi-perspective, human-centered safety benchmarks are critical for reducing biased and inconsistent moderation decisions. GuardEval and GGuard together demonstrate that diverse, representative data materially improve safety, fairness, and robustness on complex, borderline cases."}

While most existing methods rely on RGB appearance, human pose estimation, or their combination, our work demonstrates that tracking randomly sampled image points across video frames can substantially improve recognition accuracy. Unlike prior approaches, we do not detect hands, objects, or interaction regions. Instead, we employ CoTracker to follow a set of randomly initialized points through each video and use the resulting trajectories, together with the corresponding image frames, as input to a Transformer-based recognition model. Surprisingly, our method achieves notable gains even when only the initial frame and its associated point tracks are provided, without incorporating the full video sequence. Experimental results confirm that integrating 2D point tracks consistently enhances performance compared to the same model trained without motion information, highlighting their potential as a lightweight yet effective representation for egocentric action understanding."}

However, applying VLMs to 6-DoF endoscopic camera localization presents several challenges: 1) the lack of large-scale, high-quality, densely annotated, and localization-oriented vision-language datasets in real-world medical settings; 2) limited capability for fine-grained pose regression; and 3) high computational latency when extracting temporal features from past frames. To address these issues, we first construct BREATH dataset, the largest in-vivo endoscopic localization dataset to date, collected in the complex human airway. Building on this dataset, we propose BREATH-VL, a hybrid framework that integrates semantic cues from VLMs with geometric information from vision-based registration methods for accurate 6-DoF pose estimation. Our motivation lies in the complementary strengths of both approaches: VLMs offer generalizable semantic understanding, while registration methods provide precise geometric alignment. To further enhance the VLM's ability to capture temporal context, we introduce a lightweight context-learning mechanism that encodes motion history as linguistic prompts, enabling efficient temporal reasoning without expensive video-level computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the vision-language module delivers robust semantic localization in challenging surgical scenes. Building on this, our BREATH-VL outperforms state-of-the-art vision-only localization methods in both accuracy and generalization, reducing translational error by 25.5% compared with the best-performing baseline, while achieving competitive computational latency."}

Compared with labor-intensive per-model on-device calibration, a digital-twin pipeline built on optical simulation offers a substantial advantage in generating large-scale labeled data. However, complex imaging conditions induce a domain gap between simulation and real-world images, limiting the generalization of simulation-trained models. To address this, we propose augmenting a simulation baseline with minimal unlabeled real-world images captured at random misalignment positions, mitigating the gap from a domain adaptation perspective. We introduce Domain Adaptive Active Alignment (DA3), which utilizes an autoregressive domain transformation generator and an adversarial-based feature alignment strategy to distill real-world domain information via self-supervised learning. This enables the extraction of domain-invariant image degradation features to facilitate robust misalignment prediction. Experiments on two lens types reveal that DA3 improves accuracy by 46% over a purely simulation pipeline. Notably, it approaches the performance achieved with precisely labeled real-world data collected on 3 lens samples, while reducing on-device data collection time by 98.7%. The results demonstrate that domain adaptation effectively endows simulation-trained models with robust real-world performance, validating the digital-twin pipeline as a practical solution to significantly enhance the efficiency of large-scale optical assembly."}

In this work, we study how individual concepts are acquired and forgotten, as well as how multiple concepts interact through interference and synergy. We link these behavioral dynamics to LLMs' internal Concept Circuits, computational subgraphs associated with specific concepts, and incorporate Graph Metrics to characterize circuit structure. Our analysis reveals: (1) LLMs concept circuits provide a non-trivial, statistically significant signal of concept learning and forgetting; (2) Concept circuits exhibit a stage-wise temporal pattern during continual pretraining, with an early increase followed by gradual decrease and stabilization; (3) concepts with larger learning gains tend to exhibit greater forgetting under subsequent training; (4) semantically similar concepts induce stronger interference than weakly related ones; (5) conceptual knowledge differs in their transferability, with some significantly facilitating the learning of others.

However, as the number of erased concepts grows, these methods often become inefficient and ineffective, since each concept requires a separate set of fine-tuned parameters and may degrade the overall generation quality. In this work, we propose a supertype-subtype concept hierarchy that organizes erased concepts into a parent-child structure. Each erased concept is treated as a child node, and semantically related concepts (e.g., macaw, and bald eagle) are grouped under a shared parent node, referred to as a supertype concept (e.g., bird). Rather than erasing concepts individually, we introduce an effective and efficient group-wise suppression method, where semantically similar concepts are grouped and erased jointly by sharing a single set of learnable parameters. During the erasure phase, standard diffusion regularization is applied to preserve denoising process in unmasked regions. To mitigate the degradation of supertype generation caused by excessive erasure of semantically related subtypes, we propose a novel method called Supertype-Preserving Low-Rank Adaptation (SuPLoRA), which encodes the supertype concept information in the frozen down-projection matrix and updates only the up-projection matrix during erasure. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of SuPLoRA in mitigating generation performance degradation. We construct a more challenging benchmark that requires simultaneous erasure of concepts across diverse domains, including celebrities, objects, and pornographic content."}

However, existing CIR methods suffer from representation space fragmentation: queries and targets comprise heterogeneous modalities and are processed by distinct encoders, forcing models to bridge misaligned representation spaces only through post-hoc alignment, which fundamentally limits retrieval performance. This architectural asymmetry manifests as three distinct, well-separated clusters in the feature space, directly demonstrating how heterogeneous modalities create fundamentally misaligned representation spaces from initialization. In this work, we propose CSMCIR, a unified representation framework that achieves efficient query-target alignment through three synergistic components. First, we introduce a Multi-level Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) prompting strategy that guides Multimodal Large Language Models to generate discriminative, semantically compatible captions for target images, establishing modal symmetry. Building upon this, we design a symmetric dual-tower architecture where both query and target sides utilize the identical shared-parameter Q-Former for cross-modal encoding, ensuring consistent feature representations and further reducing the alignment gap. Finally, this architectural symmetry enables an entropy-based, temporally dynamic Memory Bank strategy that provides high-quality negative samples while maintaining consistency with the evolving model state. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our CSMCIR achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior training efficiency. Comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of each proposed component."}

To address this gap, we move beyond refusal-centric metrics and introduce \\texttt{PsychEthicsBench}, the first principle-grounded benchmark based on Australian psychology and psychiatry guidelines, designed to evaluate LLMs' ethical knowledge and behavioral responses through multiple-choice and open-ended tasks with fine-grained ethicality annotations. Empirical results across 14 models reveal that refusal rates are poor indicators of ethical behavior, revealing a significant divergence between safety triggers and clinical appropriateness.

This paper revisits a fundamental yet seldom systematically studied question: how VLM choice and competence translate to downstream VLA policies performance? We introduce VLM4VLA, a minimal adaptation pipeline that converts general-purpose VLMs into VLA policies using only a small set of new learnable parameters for fair and efficient comparison. Despite its simplicity, VLM4VLA proves surprisingly competitive with more sophisticated network designs. Through extensive empirical studies on various downstream tasks across three benchmarks, we find that while VLM initialization offers a consistent benefit over training from scratch, a VLM's general capabilities are poor predictors of its downstream task performance. This challenges common assumptions, indicating that standard VLM competence is necessary but insufficient for effective embodied control. We further investigate the impact of specific embodied capabilities by fine-tuning VLMs on seven auxiliary embodied tasks (e.g., embodied QA, visual pointing, depth estimation). Contrary to intuition, improving a VLM's performance on specific embodied skills does not guarantee better downstream control performance. Finally, modality-level ablations identify the visual module in VLM, rather than the language component, as the primary performance bottleneck. We demonstrate that injecting control-relevant supervision into the vision encoder of the VLM yields consistent gains, even when the encoder remains frozen during downstream fine-tuning. This isolates a persistent domain gap between current VLM pretraining objectives and the requirements of embodied action-planning."}

When a user code-switches in their prompt to an LLM, they typically do not specify the expected language of the LLM response, and thus LLMs must infer the output language from contextual and pragmatic cues. We find that current LLMs systematically fail to align with this expectation, responding in undesired languages even when cues are clear to humans. We introduce OLA, a benchmark to evaluate LLMs' Output Language Alignment in code-switched interactions. OLA focuses on Korean--English code-switching and spans simple intra-sentential mixing to instruction-content mismatches. Even frontier models frequently misinterpret implicit language expectation, exhibiting a bias toward non-English responses. We further show this bias generalizes beyond Korean to Chinese and Indonesian pairs. Models also show instability through mid-response switching and language intrusions. Chain-of-Thought prompting fails to resolve these errors, indicating weak pragmatic reasoning about output language. However, Code-Switching Aware DPO with minimal data (about 1K examples) substantially reduces misalignment, suggesting these failures stem from insufficient alignment rather than fundamental limitations. Our results highlight the need to align multilingual LLMs with users' implicit expectations in real-world code-switched interactions."}

Recent approaches rely on externally provided graphs and do not explore how LLMs can construct and use their own graph-structured reasoning, particularly in open-domain QA. To fill this gap, we novelly explore graph-structured reasoning of LLMs in general-domain question answering. We propose Self-Graph Reasoning (SGR), a framework that enables LLMs to explicitly represent their reasoning process as a structured graph before producing the final answer. We further construct a graph-structured reasoning dataset that merges multiple candidate reasoning graphs into refined graph structures for model training. Experiments on five QA benchmarks across both general and specialized domains show that SGR consistently improves reasoning consistency and yields a 17.74% gain over the base model.

Given a multiview sequence, we extract a FLAME mesh, solve a curvature-weighted Poisson equation, and obtain its exaggerated form. However, directly deforming the Gaussians yields poor results, necessitating the synthesis of pseudo-ground-truth caricature images by warping each frame to its exaggerated 2D representation using local affine transformations. We then devise a training scheme that alternates real and synthesized supervision, enabling a single Gaussian collection to represent both natural and exaggerated avatars. This scheme improves fidelity, supports local edits, and allows continuous control over the intensity of the caricature. In order to achieve real-time deformations, an efficient interpolation between the original and exaggerated surfaces is introduced. We further analyze and show that it has a bounded deviation from closed-form solutions. In both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, our results outperform prior work, delivering photorealistic, geometry-controlled caricature avatars."}

By bypassing standard library containers in favor of direct memory mapping (mmap) and implementing hand-tuned NEON SIMD kernels, we achieve a form of \"Software-Defined Direct Memory Access (DMA).\" Our proposed Tensor Virtualization Layout (TVL) guarantees 100% cache line utilization for weight matrices, while our zero-copy loader eliminates initialization latency. Experimental results on a 110M parameter model demonstrate a stable throughput of >60 tokens/second on M2 hardware.

To address these limitations, we propose I2E, a novel \"Decompose-then-Action\" paradigm that revisits image editing as an actionable interaction process within a structured environment. I2E utilizes a Decomposer to transform unstructured images into discrete, manipulable object layers and then introduces a physics-aware Vision-Language-Action Agent to parse complex instructions into a series of atomic actions via Chain-of-Thought reasoning. Further, we also construct I2E-Bench, a benchmark designed for multi-instance spatial reasoning and high-precision editing.

This necessitates a new class of model robustness analysis: robustness of the predictive reasoning under adversarial attacks, which goes beyond existing paradigm that mainly focuses on the shifts of the final predictions (e.g., fake v.s. real). To analyze such reasoning shifts, we introduce a forensic auditing framework to evaluate the robustness of ALMs' reasoning under adversarial attacks in three inter-connected dimensions: acoustic perception, cognitive coherence, and cognitive dissonance. Our systematic analysis reveals that explicit reasoning does not universally enhance robustness. Instead, we observe a bifurcation: for models exhibiting robust acoustic perception, reasoning acts as a defensive \\textit{``shield''}, protecting them from adversarial attacks. However, for others, it imposes a performance \\textit{``tax''}, particularly under linguistic attacks which reduce cognitive coherence and increase attack success rate. Crucially, even when classification fails, high cognitive dissonance can serve as a \\textit{silent alarm}, flagging potential manipulation. Overall, this work provides a critical evaluation of the role of reasoning in forensic audio deepfake analysis and its vulnerabilities."}

This tendency limits the models' ability to capture intricate dynamics and fine-grained visual causality. To explicitly bridge this gap, we propose a novel post-training objective: Masked Video Prediction (MVP). By requiring the model to reconstruct a masked continuous segment from a set of challenging distractors, MVP forces the model to attend to the sequential logic and temporal context of events. To support scalable training, we introduce a scalable data synthesis pipeline capable of transforming arbitrary video corpora into MVP training samples, and further employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a fine-grained reward function to enhance the model's understanding of video context and temporal properties. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that MVP enhances video reasoning capabilities by directly reinforcing temporal reasoning and causal understanding."}

We discover a strong causal relationship between metaphors in training data and the misalignment degree of LLMs' reasoning contents. With interventions using metaphors in pre-training, fine-tuning and re-alignment phases, models' cross-domain misalignment degrees change significantly.

In this paper, we present different techniques for substituting CAD files to create synthetic datasets.

We demonstrate that using highly representative 3D models acquired by scanning or using image-to-3D approaches can be used to generate synthetic data for training object detection models.

We introduce Eye-Q, a multilingual benchmark designed to assess this form of complex visual understanding. Eye-Q contains 1,343 puzzles in which a model observes a conceptually dense scene with a brief description and must infer a specific target word or phrase.

We fine-tune LLMs with Low-Rank Adaptation on a novel repository of more than 6,000 empirically evaluated PyTorch augmentation functions, each annotated solely by downstream model accuracy. Training uses pairwise performance ordering (better-worse transformations), enabling alignment through empirical feedback without reinforcement learning, reward models, or symbolic objectives. This reduces the need for exhaustive search, achieving up to 600x times fewer evaluated candidates than brute-force discovery while maintaining competitive peak accuracy and shifting generation from random synthesis to task-aligned design. Ablation studies show that structured Chain-of-Thought prompting introduces syntactic noise and degrades performance, whereas direct prompting ensures stable optimization in performance-critical code tasks. Qualitative and quantitative analyses demonstrate that the model internalizes semantic performance cues rather than memorizing syntax.

To address this, we propose Agent-Dice, a parameter fusion framework based on directional consensus evaluation. Concretely, Agent-Dice disentangles knowledge updates through a two-stage process: geometric consensus filtering to prune conflicting gradients, and curvature-based importance weighting to amplify shared semantics. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis that establishes the validity of the proposed fusion scheme and offers insight into the origins of the stability-plasticity dilemma. Extensive experiments on GUI agents and tool-use agent domains demonstrate that Agent-Dice exhibits outstanding continual learning performance with minimal computational overhead and parameter updates."}

We introduce LLM-MC-Affect, a probabilistic framework that characterizes emotion not as a static label, but as a continuous latent probability distribution defined over an affective space. By leveraging stochastic LLM decoding and Monte Carlo estimation, the methodology approximates these distributions to derive high-fidelity sentiment trajectories that explicitly quantify both central affective tendencies and perceptual ambiguity. These trajectories enable a structured analysis of interpersonal coupling through sequential cross-correlation and slope-based indicators, identifying leading or lagging influences between interlocutors. To validate the interpretive capacity of this approach, we utilize teacher-student instructional dialogues as a representative case study, where our quantitative indicators successfully distill high-level interaction insights such as effective scaffolding.

Existing methods typically rely solely on a single warp to estimate depth probability, which hinders their ability to fully leverage cross-view geometric cues, resulting in unstable and coarse depth maps. To address this limitation, we propose IDESplat, which iteratively applies warp operations to boost depth probability estimation for accurate Gaussian mean prediction. First, to eliminate the inherent instability of a single warp, we introduce a Depth Probability Boosting Unit (DPBU) that integrates epipolar attention maps produced by cascading warp operations in a multiplicative manner. Next, we construct an iterative depth estimation process by stacking multiple DPBUs, progressively identifying potential depth candidates with high likelihood. As IDESplat iteratively boosts depth probability estimates and updates the depth candidates, the depth map is gradually refined, resulting in accurate Gaussian means. We conduct experiments on RealEstate10K, ACID, and DL3DV. IDESplat achieves outstanding reconstruction quality and state-of-the-art performance with real-time efficiency. On RE10K, it outperforms DepthSplat by 0.33 dB in PSNR, using only 10.7% of the parameters and 70% of the memory.

Using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) to measure absolute agreement, we find that LLM judgments are not perfectly consistent across scales on subjective benchmarks, and that the choice of scale substantially shifts human-LLM agreement, even when within-group panel reliability is high.

The common practice of fully fine-tuning the vision encoder on driving datasets potentially limits its generalization by causing the model to specialize too heavily in the training data. This work challenges the necessity of this training paradigm. We propose FROST-Drive, a novel E2E architecture designed to preserve and leverage the powerful generalization capabilities of a pretrained vision encoder from a Vision-Language Model (VLM). By keeping the encoder's weights frozen, our approach directly transfers the rich, generalized world knowledge from the VLM to the driving task. Our model architecture combines this frozen encoder with a transformer-based adapter for multimodal fusion and a GRU-based decoder for smooth waypoint generation. Furthermore, we introduce a custom loss function designed to directly optimize for Rater Feedback Score (RFS), a metric that prioritizes robust trajectory planning. We conduct extensive experiments on Waymo Open E2E Dataset, a large-scale datasets deliberately curated to capture the long-tail scenarios, demonstrating that our frozen-encoder approach significantly outperforms models that employ full fine-tuning. Our results provide substantial evidence that preserving the broad knowledge of a capable VLM is a more effective strategy for achieving robust, generalizable driving performance than intensive domain-specific adaptation. This offers a new pathway for developing vision-based models that can better handle the complexities of real-world application domains."}

Currently, obtaining accurate segmentation outcomes is critically reliant on large-scale datasets with high-quality annotations. However, noisy annotations are frequently encountered owing to the complex morphological structures of organs in medical images and variations among different annotators, which can substantially limit the efficacy of segmentation models. Motivated by the fact that medical imaging annotator can correct labeling errors during segmentation based on prior knowledge, we propose an end-to-end Staged Voxel-Level Deep Reinforcement Learning (SVL-DRL) framework for robust medical image segmentation under noisy annotations. This framework employs a dynamic iterative update strategy to automatically mitigate the impact of erroneous labels without requiring manual intervention. The key advancements of SVL-DRL over existing works include: i) formulating noisy annotations as a voxel-dependent problem and addressing it through a novel staged reinforcement learning framework which guarantees robust model convergence; ii) incorporating a voxel-level asynchronous advantage actor-critic (vA3C) module that conceptualizes each voxel as an autonomous agent, which allows each agent to dynamically refine its own state representation during training, thereby directly mitigating the influence of erroneous labels; iii) designing a novel action space for the agents, along with a composite reward function that strategically combines the Dice value and a spatial continuity metric to significantly boost segmentation accuracy while maintain semantic integrity. Experiments on three public medical image datasets demonstrates State-of-The-Art (SoTA) performance under various experimental settings, with an average improvement of over 3\\% in both Dice and IoU scores."}

This motivates omni-modal embedding models that map heterogeneous modalities into a shared space for direct comparison. However, most recent omni-modal embeddings still rely heavily on implicit alignment inherited from pretrained vision-language model (VLM) backbones. In practice, this causes three common issues: (i) similarity logits have modality-dependent sharpness, so scores are not on a consistent scale; (ii) in-batch negatives become less effective over time because mixed-modality batches create an imbalanced hardness distribution; as a result, many negatives quickly become trivial and contribute little gradient; and (iii) embeddings across modalities show mismatched first- and second-order statistics, which makes rankings less stable. To tackle these problems, we propose e5-omni, a lightweight explicit alignment recipe that adapts off-the-shelf VLMs into robust omni-modal embedding models. e5-omni combines three simple components: (1) modality-aware temperature calibration to align similarity scales, (2) a controllable negative curriculum with debiasing to focus on confusing negatives while reducing the impact of false negatives, and (3) batch whitening with covariance regularization to better match cross-modal geometry in the shared embedding space. Experiments on MMEB-V2 and AudioCaps show consistent gains over strong bi-modal and omni-modal baselines, and the same recipe also transfers well to other VLM backbones.

Despite its importance, the task remains challenging due to the complexity of defining topic boundaries, the variability in discourse structure, and the need to balance local coherence with global context. These difficulties hinder downstream applications such as summarization, information retrieval, and question answering. In this work, we introduce SegNSP, framing linear text segmentation as a next sentence prediction (NSP) task. Although NSP has largely been abandoned in modern pre-training, its explicit modeling of sentence-to-sentence continuity makes it a natural fit for detecting topic boundaries. We propose a label-agnostic NSP approach, which predicts whether the next sentence continues the current topic without requiring explicit topic labels, and enhance it with a segmentation-aware loss combined with harder negative sampling to better capture discourse continuity. Unlike recent proposals that leverage NSP alongside auxiliary topic classification, our approach avoids task-specific supervision. We evaluate our model against established baselines on two datasets, CitiLink-Minutes, for which we establish the first segmentation benchmark, and WikiSection. On CitiLink-Minutes, SegNSP achieves a B-$F_1$ of 0.79, closely aligning with human-annotated topic transitions, while on WikiSection it attains a B-F$_1$ of 0.65, outperforming the strongest reproducible baseline, TopSeg, by 0.17 absolute points.

However, screenshots are tokenized into thousands of visual tokens (e.g., about 4700 for 2K resolution), incurring significant computational overhead and diluting attention. In contrast, humans typically focus on regions of interest when interacting with UI. In this work, we pioneer the task of efficient UI grounding. Guided by practical analysis of the task's characteristics and challenges, we propose FocusUI, an efficient UI grounding framework that selects patches most relevant to the instruction while preserving positional continuity for precise grounding. FocusUI addresses two key challenges: (1) Eliminating redundant tokens in visual encoding. We construct patch-level supervision by fusing an instruction-conditioned score with a rule-based UI-graph score that down-weights large homogeneous regions to select distinct and instruction-relevant visual tokens. (2) Preserving positional continuity during visual token selection. We find that general visual token pruning methods suffer from severe accuracy degradation on UI grounding tasks due to broken positional information. We introduce a novel PosPad strategy, which compresses each contiguous sequence of dropped visual tokens into a single special marker placed at the sequence's last index to preserve positional continuity. Comprehensive experiments on four grounding benchmarks demonstrate that FocusUI surpasses GUI-specific baselines. On the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, FocusUI-7B achieves a performance improvement of 3.7% over GUI-Actor-7B. Even with only 30% visual token retention, FocusUI-7B drops by only 3.2% while achieving up to 1.44x faster inference and 17% lower peak GPU memory."}

However, this language-like formulation overlooks key properties of vision, particularly the hierarchical and residual network designs that have long been essential for convergence and efficiency in visual models. To bring \"vision\" back to vision, we propose the Residual Tokenizer (ResTok), a 1D visual tokenizer that builds hierarchical residuals for both image tokens and latent tokens. The hierarchical representations obtained through progressively merging enable cross-level feature fusion at each layer, substantially enhancing representational capacity. Meanwhile, the semantic residuals between hierarchies prevent information overlap, yielding more concentrated latent distributions that are easier for AR modeling. Cross-level bindings consequently emerge without any explicit constraints. To accelerate the generation process, we further introduce a hierarchical AR generator that substantially reduces sampling steps by predicting an entire level of latent tokens at once rather than generating them strictly token-by-token. Extensive experiments demonstrate that restoring hierarchical residual priors in visual tokenization significantly improves AR image generation, achieving a gFID of 2.34 on ImageNet-256 with only 9 sampling steps.

While existing research focuses on mitigating language priors or high-level statistical biases, they often overlook the internal complexities of the visual encoding process. We identify that visual statistical bias, arising from the inherent Bag-of-Patches behavior of Vision Encoders under weak structural supervision, acts as a contributing factor of object hallucinations. Under this bias, models prioritize local texture features within individual patches over holistic geometric structures. This tendency may induce spurious visual confidence and result in hallucinations. To address this, we introduce a training-free algorithm called Structure-Disrupted Contrastive Decoding (SDCD), which performs contrastive calibration of the output distribution by introducing a shuffled structure-disrupted view. By penalizing tokens that maintain high confidence under this structure-less view, SDCD effectively suppresses the texture-driven bias. Experimental results demonstrate that SDCD significantly mitigates hallucinations across multiple benchmarks and enhances the overall multimodal capabilities of LVLMs."}

Despite this, existing human motion synthesis methods fall short: some ignore hand motions entirely, while others generate full-body motions only for narrowly scoped tasks under highly constrained settings. A key obstacle is the lack of large-scale datasets that jointly capture diverse full-body motion with detailed hand articulation. While some datasets capture both, they are limited in scale and diversity. Conversely, large-scale datasets typically focus either on body motion without hands or on hand motions without the body. To overcome this, we curate and unify existing hand motion datasets with large-scale body motion data to generate full-body sequences that capture both hand and body. We then propose the first diffusion-based unconditional full-body motion prior, FUSION, which jointly models body and hand motion. Despite using a pose-based motion representation, FUSION surpasses state-of-the-art skeletal control models on the Keypoint Tracking task in the HumanML3D dataset and achieves superior motion naturalness. Beyond standard benchmarks, we demonstrate that FUSION can go beyond typical uses of motion priors through two applications: (1) generating detailed full-body motion including fingers during interaction given the motion of an object, and (2) generating Self-Interaction motions using an LLM to transform natural language cues into actionable motion constraints. For these applications, we develop an optimization pipeline that refines the latent space of our diffusion model to generate task-specific motions. Experiments on these tasks highlight precise control over hand motion while maintaining plausible full-body coordination. The code will be public."}

We propose a structured evaluation framework for AI story generation comprising four components (Novelty, Value, Adherence, and Resonance) and eleven sub-components. Using controlled story generation via ``Spike Prompting'' and a crowdsourced study of 115 readers, we examine how different creative components shape both immediate and reflective human creativity judgments. Our findings show that creativity is evaluated hierarchically rather than cumulatively, with different dimensions becoming salient at different stages of judgment, and that reflective evaluation substantially alters both ratings and inter-rater agreement. Together, these results support the effectiveness of our framework in revealing dimensions of creativity that are obscured by reference-based evaluation."}

Existing speed-up approaches typically rely on retraining the model or designing sophisticated prompting, which are either prohibitively expensive or highly sensitive to the input and prompt formulation. In this work, we study model merging as a lightweight alternative for efficient reasoning: by combining a long chain-of-thought (Long-CoT) reasoning model with a Short-CoT instruction model, we obtain an adaptive reasoner without training from scratch or requiring large-scale additional data. Building on this idea, we propose Reasoning Pattern Alignment Merging (RPAM), a layer-wise model merging framework based on feature alignment to facilitate query-adaptive reasoning. RPAM first constructs a small pattern-labeled calibration set that assigns each query an appropriate reasoning pattern. It then optimizes layer-wise merging coefficients by aligning the merged model's intermediate representations with those of the selected model, while a contrastive objective explicitly pushes them away from the non-selected model. Experiments on seven widely used reasoning benchmarks show that RPAM substantially reduces inference cost while maintaining strong performance. Upon article acceptance, we will provide open-source code to reproduce experiments for RPAM."}

Various researchers have already advanced inherently non-linear neuron models, such as quadratic neurons, generalized operational neurons, generative neurons, and super neurons, which offer stronger non-linearity compared to point-wise activation functions. In this paper, we introduce a novel and better non-linear neuron model called Padé neurons (Paons), inspired by Padé approximants. Paons offer several advantages, such as diversity of non-linearity, since each Paon learns a different non-linear function of its inputs, and layer efficiency, since Paons provide stronger non-linearity in much fewer layers compared to piecewise linear approximation. Furthermore, Paons include all previously proposed neuron models as special cases, thus any neuron model in any network can be replaced by Paons. We note that there has been a proposal to employ the Padé approximation as a generalized point-wise activation function, which is fundamentally different from our model. To validate the efficacy of Paons, in our experiments, we replace classic neurons in some well-known neural image super-resolution, compression, and classification models based on the ResNet architecture with Paons. Our comprehensive experimental results and analyses demonstrate that neural models built by Paons provide better or equal performance than their classic counterparts with a smaller number of layers. The PyTorch implementation code for Paon is open-sourced at https://github.com/onur-keles/Paon."}

We propose IntroLM, a method that enables causal language models to predict their own output quality during the prefilling phase without affecting generation using introspective tokens. By introducing token conditional LoRA that activates only for the introspective token, the model learns to predict the output quality for a given query while preserving the original backbone behavior and avoiding external evaluators. On question answering benchmarks, IntroLM applied to Qwen3 8B achieves a ROC AUC of 90 precent for success prediction, outperforming a DeBERTa classifier by 14 precent.

To address this gap, we introduce REACT, a frame-level reward model designed specifically for structural distortions evaluation in generative videos. REACT assigns point-wise scores and attribution labels by reasoning over video frames, focusing on recognizing distortions. To support this, we construct a large-scale human preference dataset, annotated based on our proposed taxonomy of structural distortions, and generate additional data using a efficient Chain-of-Thought (CoT) synthesis pipeline. REACT is trained with a two-stage framework: ((1) supervised fine-tuning with masked loss for domain knowledge injection, followed by (2) reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and pairwise rewards to enhance reasoning capability and align output scores with human preferences. During inference, a dynamic sampling mechanism is introduced to focus on frames most likely to exhibit distortion. We also present REACT-Bench, a benchmark for generative video distortion evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that REACT complements existing reward models in assessing structutal distortion, achieving both accurate quantitative evaluations and interpretable attribution analysis."}

We introduce ADEPT (Adaptive Dynamic Early-exit Process for Transformers), a novel approach designed to overcome this issue and enable dynamic early exit in both the prefill and generation phases. The proposed adaptive token-level early-exit mechanism adjusts computation dynamically based on token complexity, optimizing efficiency without compromising performance. ADEPT further enhances KV generation procedure by decoupling sequential dependencies in skipped layers, making token-level early exit more practical.

Mem-Gallery features high-quality multi-session conversations grounded in both visual and textual information, with long interaction horizons and rich multimodal dependencies.

In this work, we introduce an annotation-efficient segmentation approach that reframes the pixel-level task into a binary region classification problem.

We design an automated pipeline to efficiently collect preference pair data that generates preference pairs with a single inference per prompt, eliminating the need for external critic models or manual annotation. Specifically, we treat high-quality real videos as positive samples and generate corresponding negatives by locally corrupting them with random spatio-temporal masks and restoring only the masked regions using the frozen base model. During training, we introduce a region-aware DPO loss that restricts preference learning to corrupted areas for rapid convergence. Experiments on Wan2.1 and CogVideoX demonstrate that LocalDPO consistently improves video fidelity, temporal coherence and human preference scores over other post-training approaches, establishing a more efficient and fine-grained paradigm for video generator alignment."}

While this suggests a promising solution for the LLM long-context bottleneck, we investigate a critical question: \"Visual merit or linguistic crutch - which drives DeepSeek-OCR's performance?\" By employing sentence-level and word-level semantic corruption, we isolate the model's intrinsic OCR capabilities from its language priors. Results demonstrate that without linguistic support, DeepSeek-OCR's performance plummets from approximately 90% to 20%. Comparative benchmarking against 13 baseline models reveals that traditional pipeline OCR methods exhibit significantly higher robustness to such semantic perturbations than end-to-end methods. Furthermore, we find that lower visual token counts correlate with increased reliance on priors, exacerbating hallucination risks. Context stress testing also reveals a total model collapse around 10,000 text tokens, suggesting that current optical compression techniques may paradoxically aggravate the long-context bottleneck.

We introduce a context-based assessment protocol that sequentially administers standardized questionnaires for privacy attitudes, prosocialness, and acceptance of data sharing within a bounded, history-carrying session. To evaluate value-action alignments under competing attitudes, we use multi-group structural equation modeling (MGSEM) to identify relations from privacy concerns and prosocialness to data sharing.

To systematically investigate this, we propose the LogicGraph Perturbation Protocol that structurally injects perturbations into the reasoning chains of diverse LMMs spanning both native reasoning architectures and prompt-driven paradigms to evaluate their self-reflection capabilities. The results reveal that models successfully self-correct in less than 10% of cases and predominantly succumb to blind textual error propagation.

Existing approaches typically restrict students to following a single golden rationale and treat different reasoning paths independently. Due to distinct inductive biases and intrinsic preferences, alongside the student's evolving capacity and reasoning preferences during training, a teacher's \"optimal\" rationale could act as out-of-distribution noise. This misalignment leads to a degeneration of the student's latent reasoning distribution, causing suboptimal performance. To bridge this gap, we propose MIND, a capability-adaptive framework that transitions distillation from passive mimicry to active cognitive construction. We synthesize diverse teacher perspectives through a novel \"Teaching Assistant\" network. By employing a Feedback-Driven Inertia Calibration mechanism, this network utilizes inertia-filtered training loss to align supervision with the student's current adaptability, effectively enhancing performance while mitigating catastrophic forgetting.

Our approach centers on a multi-agent workflow where collaborative AI agents simulate complex tool-integrated reasoning to generate diverse and high-fidelity data end-to-end. Leveraging this synthesized data, we develop a two-stage training strategy that integrates supervised fine-tuning with a novel reinforcement learning method, designed to maximize model alignment and capability.

In contrast, real-world reasoning requires integrating multiple premises and solving subproblems in parallel. Existing methods, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), express reasoning in a linear textual form, which may appear coherent but frequently leads to inconsistent conclusions. Recent approaches rely on externally provided graphs and do not explore how LLMs can construct and use their own graph-structured reasoning, particularly in open-domain QA. To fill this gap, we novelly explore graph-structured reasoning of LLMs in general-domain question answering. We propose Self-Graph Reasoning (SGR), a framework that enables LLMs to explicitly represent their reasoning process as a structured graph before producing the final answer. We further construct a graph-structured reasoning dataset that merges multiple candidate reasoning graphs into refined graph structures for model training. Experiments on five QA benchmarks across both general and specialized domains show that SGR consistently improves reasoning consistency and yields a 17.74% gain over the base model. The LLaMA-3.3-70B model fine-tuned with SGR performs comparably to GPT-4o and surpasses Claude-3.5-Haiku, demonstrating the effectiveness of graph-structured reasoning."}

In this study, we propose a novel multimodal approach that leverages pixel-wise two-dimensional (2D) representations to encode visual property variations from SITS more effectively. Specifically, we generate recurrence plots from pixel-based vegetation index time series (NDVI, EVI, and SAVI) as an alternative to using raw pixel values, creating more informative representations. Additionally, we introduce PIxel-wise Multimodal Contrastive (PIMC), a new multimodal self-supervision approach that produces effective encoders based on two-dimensional pixel time series representations and remote sensing imagery (RSI). To validate our approach, we assess its performance on three downstream tasks: pixel-level forecasting and classification using the PASTIS dataset, and land cover classification on the EuroSAT dataset. Moreover, we compare our results to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on all downstream tasks. Our experimental results show that the use of 2D representations significantly enhances feature extraction from SITS, while contrastive learning improves the quality of representations for both pixel time series and RSI. These findings suggest that our multimodal method outperforms existing models in various Earth observation tasks, establishing it as a robust self-supervision framework for processing both SITS and RSI.

Thus far, the role of the source of the retrieved information has gone unexamined. We address this gap with a novel framework to investigate how source preferences affect LLM resolution of inter-context knowledge conflicts in English, motivated by interdisciplinary research on credibility. With a comprehensive, tightly-controlled evaluation of 13 open-weight LLMs, we find that LLMs prefer institutionally-corroborated information (e.g., government or newspaper sources) over information from people and social media. However, these source preferences can be reversed by simply repeating information from less credible sources. To mitigate repetition effects and maintain consistent preferences, we propose a novel method that reduces repetition bias by up to 99.8%, while also maintaining at least 88.8% of original preferences. We release all data and code to encourage future work on credibility and source preferences in knowledge-intensive NLP."}

Non-commercial approaches still suffer audio-visual asynchrony, poor lip-speech alignment, and unimodal degradation, which can be stemmed from weak audio-visual correspondence modeling, limited generalization, and scarce high-quality dense-caption data. To address these issues, we introduce Klear and delve into three axes--model architecture, training strategy, and data curation. Architecturally, we adopt a single-tower design with unified DiT blocks and an Omni-Full Attention mechanism, achieving tight audio-visual alignment and strong scalability. Training-wise, we adopt a progressive multitask regime--random modality masking to joint optimization across tasks, and a multistage curriculum, yielding robust representations, strengthening A-V aligned world knowledge, and preventing unimodal collapse. For datasets, we present the first large-scale audio-video dataset with dense captions, and introduce a novel automated data-construction pipeline which annotates and filters millions of diverse, high-quality, strictly aligned audio-video-caption triplets. Building on this, Klear scales to large datasets, delivering high-fidelity, semantically and temporally aligned, instruction-following generation in both joint and unimodal settings while generalizing robustly to out-of-distribution scenarios. Across tasks, it substantially outperforms prior methods by a large margin and achieves performance comparable to Veo 3, offering a unified, scalable path toward next-generation audio-video synthesis."}

In this work, we examine this phenomenon across 10 languages, while we focus not only on potential misuse of personalization capabilities, but also on potential benefits they offer. Overall, we cover 1080 combinations of various personalization aspects in the prompts, for which the texts are generated by 16 distinct language models (17,280 texts in total). Our results indicate that there are differences in personalization quality of the generated texts when targeting demographic groups and when targeting social-media platforms across languages.

Key difficulties include modeling complex multi-scale evolution, correcting inter-frame feature misalignment caused by displacement, and efficiently capturing long-range spatiotemporal context without sacrificing spatial fidelity. To address these issues, we present the Multi-scale Feature Communication Rectified Flow (RF) Network (MFC-RFNet), a generative framework that integrates multi-scale communication with guided feature fusion. To enhance multi-scale fusion while retaining fine detail, a Wavelet-Guided Skip Connection (WGSC) preserves high-frequency components, and a Feature Communication Module (FCM) promotes bidirectional cross-scale interaction. To correct inter-frame displacement, a Condition-Guided Spatial Transform Fusion (CGSTF) learns spatial transforms from conditioning echoes to align shallow features. The backbone adopts rectified flow training to learn near-linear probability-flow trajectories, enabling few-step sampling with stable fidelity. Additionally, lightweight Vision-RWKV (RWKV) blocks are placed at the encoder tail, the bottleneck, and the first decoder layer to capture long-range spatiotemporal dependencies at low spatial resolutions with moderate compute. Evaluations on four public datasets (SEVIR, MeteoNet, Shanghai, and CIKM) demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines, yielding clearer echo morphology at higher rain-rate thresholds and sustained skill at longer lead times. These results suggest that the proposed synergy of RF training with scale-aware communication, spatial alignment, and frequency-aware fusion presents an effective and robust approach for radar-based nowcasting."}

We propose Diffusion-DRF, a differentiable reward flow for fine-tuning video diffusion models using a frozen, off-the-shelf Vision-Language Model (VLM) as a training-free critic. Diffusion-DRF directly backpropagates VLM feedback through the diffusion denoising chain, converting logit-level responses into token-aware gradients for optimization. We propose an automated, aspect-structured prompting pipeline to obtain reliable multi-dimensional VLM feedback, while gradient checkpointing enables efficient updates through the final denoising steps. Diffusion-DRF improves video quality and semantic alignment while mitigating reward hacking and collapse -- without additional reward models or preference datasets. It is model-agnostic and readily generalizes to other diffusion-based generative tasks."}

We ask whether these explanations nevertheless help users predict model behavior, operationalized as counterfactual simulatability. Using StrategyQA, we evaluate how well humans and LLM judges can predict a model's answers to counterfactual follow-up questions, with and without access to the model's chain-of-thought or post-hoc explanations. We compare LLM-generated counterfactuals with pragmatics-based perturbations as alternative ways to construct test cases for assessing the potential usefulness of explanations. Our results show that self-explanations consistently improve simulation accuracy for both LLM judges and humans, but the degree and stability of gains depend strongly on the perturbation strategy and judge strength. We also conduct a qualitative analysis of free-text justifications written by human users when predicting the model's behavior, which provides evidence that access to explanations helps humans form more accurate predictions on the perturbed questions."}

This motivates omni-modal embedding models that map heterogeneous modalities into a shared space for direct comparison. However, most recent omni-modal embeddings still rely heavily on implicit alignment inherited from pretrained vision-language model (VLM) backbones. In practice, this causes three common issues: (i) similarity logits have modality-dependent sharpness, so scores are not on a consistent scale; (ii) in-batch negatives become less effective over time because mixed-modality batches create an imbalanced hardness distribution; as a result, many negatives quickly become trivial and contribute little gradient; and (iii) embeddings across modalities show mismatched first- and second-order statistics, which makes rankings less stable. To tackle these problems, we propose e5-omni, a lightweight explicit alignment recipe that adapts off-the-shelf VLMs into robust omni-modal embedding models. e5-omni combines three simple components: (1) modality-aware temperature calibration to align similarity scales, (2) a controllable negative curriculum with debiasing to focus on confusing negatives while reducing the impact of false negatives, and (3) batch whitening with covariance regularization to better match cross-modal geometry in the shared embedding space. Experiments on MMEB-V2 and AudioCaps show consistent gains over strong bi-modal and omni-modal baselines, and the same recipe also transfers well to other VLM backbones.

Although recent deep models improve robustness compared to classical signal-processing approaches, many methods increase computational cost and parameter count, and attention-based temporal modeling introduces quadratic scaling with respect to the temporal length. This paper proposes ToTMNet, a lightweight rPPG architecture that replaces temporal attention with an FFT-accelerated Toeplitz temporal mixing layer. The Toeplitz operator provides full-sequence temporal receptive field using a linear number of parameters in the clip length and can be applied in near-linear time using circulant embedding and FFT-based convolution. ToTMNet integrates the global Toeplitz temporal operator into a compact gated temporal mixer that combines a local depthwise temporal convolution branch with gated global Toeplitz mixing, enabling efficient long-range temporal filtering while only having 63k parameters. Experiments on two datasets, UBFC-rPPG (real videos) and SCAMPS (synthetic videos), show that ToTMNet achieves strong heart-rate estimation accuracy with a compact design. On UBFC-rPPG intra-dataset evaluation, ToTMNet reaches 1.055 bpm MAE with Pearson correlation 0.996. In a synthetic-to-real setting (SCAMPS to UBFC-rPPG), ToTMNet reaches 1.582 bpm MAE with Pearson correlation 0.994. Ablation results confirm that the gating mechanism is important for effectively using global Toeplitz mixing, especially under domain shift. The main limitation of this preprint study is the use of only two datasets; nevertheless, the results indicate that Toeplitz-structured temporal mixing is a practical and efficient alternative to attention for rPPG."}

We find the formal contrast between sentences with multiple coordinated or subordinated clauses to be reflected in ID differences whose onset aligns with a phase of more abstract linguistic processing independently identified in earlier work. The functional contrasts between sentences characterized by right branching vs. center embedding or unambiguous vs. ambiguous relative clause attachment are also picked up by ID, but in a less marked way, and they do not correlate with the same processing phase. Further experiments using representational similarity and layer ablation confirm the same trends. We conclude that ID is a useful marker of linguistic complexity in LLMs, that it allows to differentiate between different types of complexity, and that it points to similar stages of linguistic processing across disparate LLMs."}

STEPS explicitly targets compositional generalization by uncovering latent relationships among skills and organizing them into an interpretable, hierarchical skill taxonomy using structural information theory. Building on this taxonomy, we formulate data synthesis as a constrained information maximization problem, selecting skill combinations that maximize marginal structural information within the hierarchy while preserving semantic coherence. Experiments on challenging instruction-following benchmarks show that STEPS outperforms existing data synthesis baselines, while also yielding improved compositional generalization in downstream agent-based evaluations."}

By training models on this isolated step, FSLR provides explicit supervision for logical relationship understanding, unlike CoT-SFT which implicitly embeds such relationships within complete solution trajectories.

We introduce membox, a hierarchical memory architecture centered on a Topic Loom that continuously monitors dialogue in a sliding-window fashion, grouping consecutive same-topic turns into coherent \"memory boxes\" at storage time. Sealed boxes are then linked by a Trace Weaver into long-range event-timeline traces, recovering macro-topic recurrences across discontinuities.

Yet existing perception-based bikeability assessment approaches face key limitations in capturing the complexity of road environments and adequately accounting for heterogeneity in subjective user perceptions. This paper proposes a persona-aware Vision-Language Model framework for bikeability assessment with three novel contributions: (i) theory-grounded persona conditioning based on established cyclist typology that generates persona-specific explanations via chain-of-thought reasoning; (ii) multi-granularity supervised fine-tuning that combines scarce expert-annotated reasoning with abundant user ratings for joint prediction and explainable assessment; and (iii) AI-enabled data augmentation that creates controlled paired data to isolate infrastructure variable impacts. To test and validate this framework, we developed a panoramic image-based crowdsourcing system and collected 12,400 persona-conditioned assessments from 427 cyclists. Experiment results show that the proposed framework offers competitive bikeability rating prediction while uniquely enabling explainable factor attribution."}

As humans cannot interpret thousands of documents, only a small subset of the training data can be presented as an explanation. Although the choice of which documents to include directly affects explanation quality, previous evaluations of such systems have largely ignored any selection strategies. To address this, we propose a novel selection relevance score, a retraining-free metric that quantifies how useful a set of examples is for explaining a model's output. We validate this score through fine-tuning experiments, confirming that it can predict whether a set of examples supports or undermines the model's predictions. Using this metric, we further show that common selection strategies often underperform random selection. Motivated by this finding, we propose a strategy that balances influence and representativeness, enabling better use of selection budgets than naively selecting the highest-ranking examples."}

However, existing CIR methods suffer from representation space fragmentation: queries and targets comprise heterogeneous modalities and are processed by distinct encoders, forcing models to bridge misaligned representation spaces only through post-hoc alignment, which fundamentally limits retrieval performance. This architectural asymmetry manifests as three distinct, well-separated clusters in the feature space, directly demonstrating how heterogeneous modalities create fundamentally misaligned representation spaces from initialization. In this work, we propose CSMCIR, a unified representation framework that achieves efficient query-target alignment through three synergistic components. First, we introduce a Multi-level Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) prompting strategy that guides Multimodal Large Language Models to generate discriminative, semantically compatible captions for target images, establishing modal symmetry. Building upon this, we design a symmetric dual-tower architecture where both query and target sides utilize the identical shared-parameter Q-Former for cross-modal encoding, ensuring consistent feature representations and further reducing the alignment gap. Finally, this architectural symmetry enables an entropy-based, temporally dynamic Memory Bank strategy that provides high-quality negative samples while maintaining consistency with the evolving model state. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our CSMCIR achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior training efficiency. Comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of each proposed component."}

This motivates omni-modal embedding models that map heterogeneous modalities into a shared space for direct comparison. However, most recent omni-modal embeddings still rely heavily on implicit alignment inherited from pretrained vision-language model (VLM) backbones. In practice, this causes three common issues: (i) similarity logits have modality-dependent sharpness, so scores are not on a consistent scale; (ii) in-batch negatives become less effective over time because mixed-modality batches create an imbalanced hardness distribution; as a result, many negatives quickly become trivial and contribute little gradient; and (iii) embeddings across modalities show mismatched first- and second-order statistics, which makes rankings less stable. To tackle these problems, we propose e5-omni, a lightweight explicit alignment recipe that adapts off-the-shelf VLMs into robust omni-modal embedding models. e5-omni combines three simple components: (1) modality-aware temperature calibration to align similarity scales, (2) a controllable negative curriculum with debiasing to focus on confusing negatives while reducing the impact of false negatives, and (3) batch whitening with covariance regularization to better match cross-modal geometry in the shared embedding space. Experiments on MMEB-V2 and AudioCaps show consistent gains over strong bi-modal and omni-modal baselines, and the same recipe also transfers well to other VLM backbones.

To evaluate RadDiff, we construct RadDiffBench, a challenging benchmark comprising 57 expert-validated radiology study pairs with ground-truth difference descriptions.

While this suggests a promising solution for the LLM long-context bottleneck, we investigate a critical question: \"Visual merit or linguistic crutch - which drives DeepSeek-OCR's performance?\" By employing sentence-level and word-level semantic corruption, we isolate the model's intrinsic OCR capabilities from its language priors. Results demonstrate that without linguistic support, DeepSeek-OCR's performance plummets from approximately 90% to 20%. Comparative benchmarking against 13 baseline models reveals that traditional pipeline OCR methods exhibit significantly higher robustness to such semantic perturbations than end-to-end methods. Furthermore, we find that lower visual token counts correlate with increased reliance on priors, exacerbating hallucination risks. Context stress testing also reveals a total model collapse around 10,000 text tokens, suggesting that current optical compression techniques may paradoxically aggravate the long-context bottleneck.

Existing designs follow a fragmentation-compensation paradigm: they first break dialogue streams into isolated utterances for storage, then attempt to restore coherence via embedding-based retrieval. This process irreversibly damages narrative and causal flow, while biasing retrieval towards lexical similarity. We introduce membox, a hierarchical memory architecture centered on a Topic Loom that continuously monitors dialogue in a sliding-window fashion, grouping consecutive same-topic turns into coherent \"memory boxes\" at storage time. Sealed boxes are then linked by a Trace Weaver into long-range event-timeline traces, recovering macro-topic recurrences across discontinuities. Experiments on LoCoMo demonstrate that Membox achieves up to 68% F1 improvement on temporal reasoning tasks, outperforming competitive baselines (e.g., Mem0, A-MEM).

Across three instruction-tuned LLMs and multiple CPT strategies, optimization and learning systematically diverge as loss decreases monotonically while factual learning is unstable and non-monotonic. Acquired facts are rarely consolidated, learning is strongly conditioned on prior exposure, and OOD performance degrades from early epochs. Circuit analysis reveals rapid reconfiguration of knowledge pathways across epochs, providing an explanation for narrow acquisition windows and systematic forgetting. These results show that loss optimization is misaligned with learning progress in CPT and motivate evaluation of stopping criteria based on task-level learning dynamics."}

This paper presents an evaluation of AI text detection methods, including both traditional machine learning models and transformer-based architectures. We utilize two datasets, HC3 and DAIGT v2, to build a unified benchmark and apply a topic-based data split to prevent information leakage. This approach ensures robust generalization across unseen domains. Our experiments show that TF-IDF logistic regression achieves a reasonable baseline accuracy of 82.87%.

The BiLSTM classifier achieves an accuracy of 88.86%, while DistilBERT achieves a similar accuracy of 88.11% with the highest ROC-AUC score of 0.96, demonstrating the strongest overall performance. The results indicate that contextual semantic modeling is significantly superior to lexical features and highlight the importance of mitigating topic memorization through appropriate evaluation protocols. The limitations of this work are primarily related to dataset diversity and computational constraints. In future work, we plan to expand dataset diversity and utilize parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods such as LoRA.

We first evaluate the classification performance of widely used Large Language Models (LLMs) on this dataset, establishing robust baselines for the classification of hyperpartisan and PRCT narratives. In addition, we assess the viability of using LLMs as automatic annotators for this task, analysing their ability to approximate human annotation.

Among these parameters, Gaussian means are particularly difficult to predict, so depth is usually estimated first and then unprojected to obtain the Gaussian sphere centers. Existing methods typically rely solely on a single warp to estimate depth probability, which hinders their ability to fully leverage cross-view geometric cues, resulting in unstable and coarse depth maps. To address this limitation, we propose IDESplat, which iteratively applies warp operations to boost depth probability estimation for accurate Gaussian mean prediction. First, to eliminate the inherent instability of a single warp, we introduce a Depth Probability Boosting Unit (DPBU) that integrates epipolar attention maps produced by cascading warp operations in a multiplicative manner. Next, we construct an iterative depth estimation process by stacking multiple DPBUs, progressively identifying potential depth candidates with high likelihood. As IDESplat iteratively boosts depth probability estimates and updates the depth candidates, the depth map is gradually refined, resulting in accurate Gaussian means. We conduct experiments on RealEstate10K, ACID, and DL3DV. IDESplat achieves outstanding reconstruction quality and state-of-the-art performance with real-time efficiency. On RE10K, it outperforms DepthSplat by 0.33 dB in PSNR, using only 10.7% of the parameters and 70% of the memory. Additionally, our IDESplat improves PSNR by 2.95 dB over DepthSplat on the DTU dataset in cross-dataset experiments, demonstrating its strong generalization ability."}

The experiments in this paper focus on testing small language models out of the box, fine-tuned, and run sequentially on the JFLEG and ASSET datasets using established metrics. The results show that while SLMs may learn certain behaviors well, their performance remains below strong baselines and current LLMs. The results also show that SLMs struggle with retaining meaning and hallucinations.

However, screenshots are tokenized into thousands of visual tokens (e.g., about 4700 for 2K resolution), incurring significant computational overhead and diluting attention. In contrast, humans typically focus on regions of interest when interacting with UI. In this work, we pioneer the task of efficient UI grounding. Guided by practical analysis of the task's characteristics and challenges, we propose FocusUI, an efficient UI grounding framework that selects patches most relevant to the instruction while preserving positional continuity for precise grounding. FocusUI addresses two key challenges: (1) Eliminating redundant tokens in visual encoding. We construct patch-level supervision by fusing an instruction-conditioned score with a rule-based UI-graph score that down-weights large homogeneous regions to select distinct and instruction-relevant visual tokens. (2) Preserving positional continuity during visual token selection. We find that general visual token pruning methods suffer from severe accuracy degradation on UI grounding tasks due to broken positional information. We introduce a novel PosPad strategy, which compresses each contiguous sequence of dropped visual tokens into a single special marker placed at the sequence's last index to preserve positional continuity. Comprehensive experiments on four grounding benchmarks demonstrate that FocusUI surpasses GUI-specific baselines. On the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, FocusUI-7B achieves a performance improvement of 3.7% over GUI-Actor-7B. Even with only 30% visual token retention, FocusUI-7B drops by only 3.2% while achieving up to 1.44x faster inference and 17% lower peak GPU memory."}

We design an automated pipeline to efficiently collect preference pair data that generates preference pairs with a single inference per prompt, eliminating the need for external critic models or manual annotation. Specifically, we treat high-quality real videos as positive samples and generate corresponding negatives by locally corrupting them with random spatio-temporal masks and restoring only the masked regions using the frozen base model. During training, we introduce a region-aware DPO loss that restricts preference learning to corrupted areas for rapid convergence. Experiments on Wan2.1 and CogVideoX demonstrate that LocalDPO consistently improves video fidelity, temporal coherence and human preference scores over other post-training approaches, establishing a more efficient and fine-grained paradigm for video generator alignment."}

To systematically investigate this, we propose the LogicGraph Perturbation Protocol that structurally injects perturbations into the reasoning chains of diverse LMMs spanning both native reasoning architectures and prompt-driven paradigms to evaluate their self-reflection capabilities. The results reveal that models successfully self-correct in less than 10% of cases and predominantly succumb to blind textual error propagation.

While positional bias has been studied in various contexts, from attention sinks to task performance degradation in long-context settings, prior work has not established how these biases evolve across individual layers and input positions, or how they vary independent of task complexity. We introduce an attribution-based framework to analyze positional effects in short-context language modeling. Using layer conductance with a sliding-window approach, we quantify how each layer distributes importance across input positions, yielding layer-wise positional importance profiles. We find that these profiles are architecture-specific, stable across inputs, and invariant to lexical scrambling. Characterizing these profiles, we find prominent recency bias that increases with depth and subtle primacy bias that diminishes through model depth. Beyond positional structure, we also show that early layers preferentially weight content words over function words across all positions, while later layers lose this word-type differentiation."}

However, most deep learning models are designed to process either entire images or complete time series sequences to extract meaningful features for downstream tasks. In this study, we propose a novel multimodal approach that leverages pixel-wise two-dimensional (2D) representations to encode visual property variations from SITS more effectively. Specifically, we generate recurrence plots from pixel-based vegetation index time series (NDVI, EVI, and SAVI) as an alternative to using raw pixel values, creating more informative representations. Additionally, we introduce PIxel-wise Multimodal Contrastive (PIMC), a new multimodal self-supervision approach that produces effective encoders based on two-dimensional pixel time series representations and remote sensing imagery (RSI). To validate our approach, we assess its performance on three downstream tasks: pixel-level forecasting and classification using the PASTIS dataset, and land cover classification on the EuroSAT dataset. Moreover, we compare our results to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on all downstream tasks. Our experimental results show that the use of 2D representations significantly enhances feature extraction from SITS, while contrastive learning improves the quality of representations for both pixel time series and RSI. These findings suggest that our multimodal method outperforms existing models in various Earth observation tasks, establishing it as a robust self-supervision framework for processing both SITS and RSI.

In this paper, we introduce VotIE (Voting Information Extraction), a new information extraction task aimed at identifying structured voting events in narrative deliberative records, and establish the first benchmark for this task using Portuguese municipal minutes, building on the recently introduced CitiLink corpus. Our experiments yield two key findings. First, under standard in-domain evaluation, fine-tuned encoders, specifically XLM-R-CRF, achieve the strongest performance, reaching 93.2\\% macro F1, outperforming generative approaches. Second, in a cross-municipality setting that evaluates transfer to unseen administrative contexts, these models suffer substantial performance degradation, whereas few-shot LLMs demonstrate greater robustness, with significantly smaller declines in performance. Despite this generalization advantage, the high computational cost of generative models currently constrains their practicality. As a result, lightweight fine-tuned encoders remain a more practical option for large-scale, real-world deployment.

Surprisingly, little work has been done to ensure or even measure the quality of simulated students. In this work, we formally define the student simulation task, propose a set of evaluation metrics that span linguistic, behavioral, and cognitive aspects, and benchmark a wide range of student simulation methods on these metrics. We experiment on a real-world math tutoring dialogue dataset, where both automated and human evaluation results show that prompting strategies for student simulation perform poorly; supervised fine-tuning and preference optimization yield much better but still limited performance, motivating future work on this challenging task."}

Non-commercial approaches still suffer audio-visual asynchrony, poor lip-speech alignment, and unimodal degradation, which can be stemmed from weak audio-visual correspondence modeling, limited generalization, and scarce high-quality dense-caption data. To address these issues, we introduce Klear and delve into three axes--model architecture, training strategy, and data curation. Architecturally, we adopt a single-tower design with unified DiT blocks and an Omni-Full Attention mechanism, achieving tight audio-visual alignment and strong scalability. Training-wise, we adopt a progressive multitask regime--random modality masking to joint optimization across tasks, and a multistage curriculum, yielding robust representations, strengthening A-V aligned world knowledge, and preventing unimodal collapse. For datasets, we present the first large-scale audio-video dataset with dense captions, and introduce a novel automated data-construction pipeline which annotates and filters millions of diverse, high-quality, strictly aligned audio-video-caption triplets. Building on this, Klear scales to large datasets, delivering high-fidelity, semantically and temporally aligned, instruction-following generation in both joint and unimodal settings while generalizing robustly to out-of-distribution scenarios. Across tasks, it substantially outperforms prior methods by a large margin and achieves performance comparable to Veo 3, offering a unified, scalable path toward next-generation audio-video synthesis."}

We present SpeakerSleuth, a benchmark evaluating whether LALMs can reliably judge speaker consistency in multi-turn dialogues through three tasks reflecting real-world requirements. We construct 1,818 human-verified evaluation instances across four diverse datasets spanning synthetic and real speech, with controlled acoustic difficulty. Evaluating nine widely-used LALMs, we find that models struggle to reliably detect acoustic inconsistencies. For instance, given audio samples of the same speaker's turns, some models overpredict inconsistency, whereas others are overly lenient. Models further struggle to identify the exact turns that are problematic. When other interlocutors' turns are provided together, performance degrades dramatically as models prioritize textual coherence over acoustic cues, failing to detect even obvious gender switches for a speaker. On the other hand, models perform substantially better in choosing the audio that best matches the speaker among several acoustic variants, demonstrating inherent acoustic discrimination capabilities. These findings expose a significant bias in LALMs: they tend to prioritize text over acoustics, revealing fundamental modality imbalances that need to be addressed to build reliable audio-language judges."}

These challenges are especially pronounced for low-resource languages, where limited parallel data constrains generalization and transfer. Understanding how multilingual models share knowledge across languages requires examining the interaction between representations, data availability, and training strategies. In this thesis, we study cross-lingual knowledge transfer in neural models and develop methods to improve robustness and generalization in multilingual settings, using machine translation as a central testbed. We analyze how similarity between languages influences transfer, how retrieval and auxiliary supervision can strengthen low-resource translation, and how fine-tuning on parallel data can introduce unintended trade-offs in large language models. We further examine the role of language diversity during training and show that increasing translation coverage improves generalization and reduces off-target behavior. Together, this work highlights how modeling choices and data composition shape multilingual learning and offers insights toward more inclusive and resilient multilingual NLP systems."}

It emphasizes realistic risk exposure, authentic visual inputs, and fine-grained cross-modal reasoning, ensuring that safety risks cannot be inferred from text alone.

While recent work has explored automatic prompt optimization using textual gradients and self-refinement, most existing methods treat prompts as monolithic blocks of text, making it difficult to localize errors, preserve critical instructions, or prevent uncontrolled prompt growth. We introduce Modular Prompt Optimization (MPO), a schema-based prompt optimization framework that treats prompts as structured objects composed of fixed semantic sections, including system role, context, task description, constraints, and output format. MPO applies section-local textual gradients, generated by a critic language model, to refine each section independently while keeping the overall prompt schema fixed. Section updates are consolidated through de-duplication to reduce redundancy and interference between components, yielding an interpretable and robust optimization process. We evaluate MPO on two reasoning benchmarks, ARC-Challenge and MMLU, using LLaMA-3 8B-Instruct and Mistral-7B-Instruct as solver models. Across both benchmarks and models, MPO consistently outperforms an untuned structured prompt and the TextGrad baseline, achieving substantial accuracy gains without modifying model parameters or altering prompt structure. These results demonstrate that maintaining a fixed prompt schema while applying localized, section-wise optimization is an effective and practical approach for improving reasoning performance in small open-source LMs."}

In this work, we propose \\textbf{CoM-DAD} (\\textbf{Co}upled \\textbf{M}anifold \\textbf{D}iscrete \\textbf{A}bsorbing \\textbf{D}iffusion), a novel probabilistic framework that reformulates multimodal generation as a hierarchical dual-process.

Crucially, we introduce a \\textbf{Stochastic Mixed-Modal Transport} strategy that aligns disparate modalities without requiring heavy contrastive dual-encoders. Our method demonstrates superior stability over standard masked modeling, establishing a new paradigm for scalable, unified text-image generation."}

Once the returned content directly contains targeted, ready-to-use harmful takeaways, the LLM's safeguards cannot withdraw that exposure. Motivated by this dilemma, we identify web search as a critical attack surface and propose \\textbf{\\textit{SearchAttack}} for red-teaming. SearchAttack outsources the harmful semantics to web search, retaining only the query's skeleton and fragmented clues, and further steers LLMs to reconstruct the retrieved content via structural rubrics to achieve malicious goals. Extensive experiments are conducted to red-team the search-augmented LLMs for responsible vulnerability assessment.

While positional bias has been studied in various contexts, from attention sinks to task performance degradation in long-context settings, prior work has not established how these biases evolve across individual layers and input positions, or how they vary independent of task complexity. We introduce an attribution-based framework to analyze positional effects in short-context language modeling. Using layer conductance with a sliding-window approach, we quantify how each layer distributes importance across input positions, yielding layer-wise positional importance profiles. We find that these profiles are architecture-specific, stable across inputs, and invariant to lexical scrambling. Characterizing these profiles, we find prominent recency bias that increases with depth and subtle primacy bias that diminishes through model depth. Beyond positional structure, we also show that early layers preferentially weight content words over function words across all positions, while later layers lose this word-type differentiation."}

The core of STAR-S involves eliciting reasoning and reflection guided by safety rules, then leveraging fine-tuning to enhance safety reasoning. Repeating this process creates a synergistic cycle. Improvements in the model's reasoning and interpretation of safety rules allow it to produce better reasoning data under safety rule prompts, which is then utilized for further training. Experiments show that STAR-S effectively defends against jailbreak attacks, outperforming baselines. Code is available at: https://github.com/pikepokenew/STAR_S.git."}

While recent gloss-free SLT methods have made strides in translating manual gestures, they frequently overlook the semantic criticality of facial expressions, resulting in ambiguity when distinct concepts share identical manual articulations. To address this, we present **EASLT** (**E**motion-**A**ware **S**ign **L**anguage **T**ranslation), a framework that treats facial affect not as auxiliary information, but as a robust semantic anchor. Unlike methods that relegate facial expressions to a secondary role, EASLT incorporates a dedicated emotional encoder to capture continuous affective dynamics. These representations are integrated via a novel *Emotion-Aware Fusion* (EAF) module, which adaptively recalibrates spatio-temporal sign features based on affective context to resolve semantic ambiguities. Extensive evaluations on the PHOENIX14T and CSL-Daily benchmarks demonstrate that EASLT establishes advanced performance among gloss-free methods, achieving BLEU-4 scores of 26.15 and 22.80, and BLEURT scores of 61.0 and 57.8, respectively. Ablation studies confirm that explicitly modeling emotion effectively decouples affective semantics from manual dynamics, significantly enhancing translation fidelity.

Currently, reasoning strategies are autonomously selected by LRMs themselves. However, such autonomous selection often produces inefficient or even erroneous reasoning paths. To make reasoning more reliable and flexible, it is important to develop methods for controlling reasoning strategies. Existing methods struggle to control fine-grained reasoning strategies due to conceptual entanglement in LRMs' hidden states. To address this, we leverage Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to decompose strategy-entangled hidden states into a disentangled feature space. To identify the few strategy-specific features from the vast pool of SAE features, we propose SAE-Steering, an efficient two-stage feature identification pipeline. SAE-Steering first recalls features that amplify the logits of strategy-specific keywords, filtering out over 99\\% of features, and then ranks the remaining features by their control effectiveness. Using the identified strategy-specific features as control vectors, SAE-Steering outperforms existing methods by over 15\\% in control effectiveness. Furthermore, controlling reasoning strategies can redirect LRMs from erroneous paths to correct ones, achieving a 7\\% absolute accuracy improvement."}

Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning improves accuracy but incurs prohibitive latency for real-time query correction. A potential solution is to output an answer before reasoning to reduce latency; however, under autoregressive decoding, the early answer is independent of subsequent reasoning, preventing the model from leveraging its reasoning capability to improve accuracy. To address this issue, we propose Sandwich Reasoning (SandwichR), a novel approach that explicitly aligns a fast initial answer with post-hoc reasoning, enabling low-latency query correction without sacrificing reasoning-aware accuracy. SandwichR follows an Answer-Reasoning-Answer paradigm, producing an initial correction, an explicit reasoning process, and a final refined correction. To align the initial answer with post-reasoning insights, we design a consistency-aware reinforcement learning (RL) strategy: a dedicated consistency reward enforces alignment between the initial and final corrections, while margin-based rejection sampling prioritizes borderline samples where reasoning drives the most impactful corrective gains. Additionally, we construct a high-quality query correction dataset, addressing the lack of specialized benchmarks for complex query correction. Experimental results demonstrate that SandwichR achieves SOTA accuracy comparable to standard CoT while delivering a 40-70% latency reduction, resolving the latency-accuracy trade-off in online search."}

We introduce RadDiff, a multimodal agentic system that performs radiologist-style comparative reasoning to describe clinically meaningful differences between paired radiology studies. RadDiff builds on a proposer-ranker framework from VisDiff, and incorporates four innovations inspired by real diagnostic workflows: (1) medical knowledge injection through domain-adapted vision-language models; (2) multimodal reasoning that integrates images with their clinical reports; (3) iterative hypothesis refinement across multiple reasoning rounds; and (4) targeted visual search that localizes and zooms in on salient regions to capture subtle findings. To evaluate RadDiff, we construct RadDiffBench, a challenging benchmark comprising 57 expert-validated radiology study pairs with ground-truth difference descriptions. On RadDiffBench, RadDiff achieves 47% accuracy, and 50% accuracy when guided by ground-truth reports, significantly outperforming the general-domain VisDiff baseline. We further demonstrate RadDiff's versatility across diverse clinical tasks, including COVID-19 phenotype comparison, racial subgroup analysis, and discovery of survival-related imaging features. Together, RadDiff and RadDiffBench provide the first method-and-benchmark foundation for systematically uncovering meaningful differences in radiological data."}

Generative world models offer a promising remedy: agents could use them as external simulators to foresee outcomes before acting. This paper empirically examines whether current agents can leverage such world models as tools to enhance their cognition. Across diverse agentic and visual question answering tasks, we observe that some agents rarely invoke simulation (fewer than 1%), frequently misuse predicted rollouts (approximately 15%), and often exhibit inconsistent or even degraded performance (up to 5%) when simulation is available or enforced. Attribution analysis further indicates that the primary bottleneck lies in the agents' capacity to decide when to simulate, how to interpret predicted outcomes, and how to integrate foresight into downstream reasoning. These findings underscore the need for mechanisms that foster calibrated, strategic interaction with world models, paving the way toward more reliable anticipatory cognition in future agent systems."}

However, screenshots are tokenized into thousands of visual tokens (e.g., about 4700 for 2K resolution), incurring significant computational overhead and diluting attention. In contrast, humans typically focus on regions of interest when interacting with UI. In this work, we pioneer the task of efficient UI grounding. Guided by practical analysis of the task's characteristics and challenges, we propose FocusUI, an efficient UI grounding framework that selects patches most relevant to the instruction while preserving positional continuity for precise grounding. FocusUI addresses two key challenges: (1) Eliminating redundant tokens in visual encoding. We construct patch-level supervision by fusing an instruction-conditioned score with a rule-based UI-graph score that down-weights large homogeneous regions to select distinct and instruction-relevant visual tokens. (2) Preserving positional continuity during visual token selection. We find that general visual token pruning methods suffer from severe accuracy degradation on UI grounding tasks due to broken positional information. We introduce a novel PosPad strategy, which compresses each contiguous sequence of dropped visual tokens into a single special marker placed at the sequence's last index to preserve positional continuity. Comprehensive experiments on four grounding benchmarks demonstrate that FocusUI surpasses GUI-specific baselines. On the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, FocusUI-7B achieves a performance improvement of 3.7% over GUI-Actor-7B. Even with only 30% visual token retention, FocusUI-7B drops by only 3.2% while achieving up to 1.44x faster inference and 17% lower peak GPU memory."}

However, this paradigm incurs substantial deployment costs as models often exhibit excessive verbosity on simple queries. Existing efficient reasoning methods relying on explicit length penalties often introduce optimization conflicts and leave the generative mechanisms driving overthinking largely unexamined. In this paper, we identify a phenomenon termed length shift where models increasingly generate unnecessary reasoning on trivial inputs during training. To address this, we introduce Dynamic Outlier Truncation (DOT), a training-time intervention that selectively suppresses redundant tokens. This method targets only the extreme tail of response lengths within fully correct rollout groups while preserving long-horizon reasoning capabilities for complex problems. To complement this intervention and ensure stable convergence, we further incorporate auxiliary KL regularization and predictive dynamic sampling. Experimental results across multiple model scales demonstrate that our approach significantly pushes the efficiency-performance Pareto frontier outward. Notably, on the AIME-24, our method reduces inference token usage by 78% while simultaneously increasing accuracy compared to the initial policy and surpassing state-of-the-art efficient reasoning methods."}

However, the robustness of their reasoning chains remains questionable. In this paper, we identify a critical failure mode termed textual inertia, where once a textual hallucination occurs in the thinking process, models tend to blindly adhere to the erroneous text while neglecting conflicting visual evidence. To systematically investigate this, we propose the LogicGraph Perturbation Protocol that structurally injects perturbations into the reasoning chains of diverse LMMs spanning both native reasoning architectures and prompt-driven paradigms to evaluate their self-reflection capabilities. The results reveal that models successfully self-correct in less than 10% of cases and predominantly succumb to blind textual error propagation. To mitigate this, we introduce Active Visual-Context Refinement, a training-free inference paradigm which orchestrates an active visual re-grounding mechanism to enforce fine-grained verification coupled with an adaptive context refinement strategy to summarize and denoise the reasoning history. Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly stifles hallucination propagation and enhances reasoning robustness."}
