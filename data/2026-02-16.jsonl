Specifically, we develop a virtual scatterer model to characterize the channel power gain distribution in three-dimensional (3D) space, by capturing the multi-path propagation environment structure and exploiting the angular-domain spatial correlation of scatterer response. In this model, the CGM is represented as a function over a set of tunable parameters for virtual scatterers, including their number, positions, and scatterer response coefficients (SRCs), which can be estimated from a limited number of channel power gain measurements at a given set of locations within the region of interest. This new representation offers a flexible and scalable modeling framework for efficient and accurate CGM reconstruction. Furthermore, we propose a progressive estimation algorithm to acquire the scatterers' parameters. In this algorithm, we gradually increase the number of virtual scatterers to balance the computational complexity and estimation accuracy. In addition, by exploiting the spatial correlation of scatterer response, we propose a Gaussian process regression (GPR)-based inference method to predict the SRCs that cannot be directly estimated. Finally, ray-tracing-based simulation results under realistic physical environments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating that it achieves higher reconstruction accuracy compared to conventional CGM estimation approaches."}

To deal with the formulated non-convex optimization problem, the successive convex approximation (SCA) together with the first-order Taylor expansion and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) is utilized.

In high-performance racing shoes, these foams are critical for low weight, high cushioning, and efficient energy return; yet, their constitutive behavior remains difficult to model and poorly understood. Here we integrate mechanical testing and machine learning to discover the mechanics of two ultra-low density elastomeric polymeric foams used in elite-level racing shoes. Across uniaxial tension, confined and unconfined compression, and simple shear, both foams exhibit pronounced tension-compression asymmetry, negligible lateral strains consistent with an effective Poisson's ratio close to zero, and low hysteresis indicative of an efficient energy return. Both foams provide a similar compressive stiffness (268kPa vs. 299kPa), while one foam exhibits nearly double the shear stiffness (219kPa vs. 117kPa), implying a substantially greater lateral stability at a comparable vertical energy return (83% vs. 89%). By integrating these data into constitutive neural networks, paired with sparse regression, we discover compact, interpretable single-invariant models, supplemented by mixed-invariant or principal-stretch based terms, that capture the unique signature of the foams with R2 values close to one. From a human performance perspective, these models enable finite-element and gait-level simulations of high-performance racing shoes to quantify running economy, performance enhancements, and injury risks on an individual athlete level.

In this model, items' values are drawn from an underlying distribution and mechanisms are evaluated with respect to this draw (e.g., in expectation, or with high probability). Motivated by worst-case impossibilities which show that truthfulness severely restricts fairness and efficiency, we ask whether truthful mechanisms continue to perform poorly on random instances.\n  We first focus on dominant-strategy incentive compatible (DSIC) mechanisms. For two agents, we obtain a tight picture. Specifically, we show that there exists a distribution under which no DSIC mechanism achieves an expected welfare approximation better than $\\frac{2+\\sqrt{2}}{4}\\approx 0.854$, and we give a DSIC mechanism that matches this bound for all distributions simultaneously. We further show that, for every distribution, there exists a DSIC mechanism that is envy-free with high probability and obtains the same welfare. A key ingredient is a new, tight connection between welfare guarantees of a family of DSIC, no-money mechanisms and i.i.d.\\ prophet inequalities. This connection allows us to generalize to $n$ agents; in particular, we obtain a DSIC mechanism that achieves a $\\approx 0.745$ approximation to welfare, and another DSIC mechanism achieving a $1/2$-approximation welfare that is envy-free with high probability.\n  We then turn to Bayesian incentive compatibility (BIC). Under i.i.d.\\ valuations, we show that BIC comes at essentially no cost: we design a prior-independent BIC mechanism that achieves a $(1-\\varepsilon)$-approximation to the optimal welfare, while being envy-free with high probability.

In this paper, we present FPNet, a unified deep learning framework that jointly addresses channel feedback compression, accurate indoor positioning, and robust anomaly detection (AD). FPNet leverages the beamforming feedback matrix (BFM), a compressed CSI representation natively supported by IEEE 802.11ac/ax/be protocols, to minimize feedback overhead while preserving critical positioning features. To enhance reliability, we integrate ADBlock, a lightweight AD module trained on normal BFM samples, which identifies out-of-distribution scenarios when users exit predefined spatial regions. Experimental results using standard 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi hardware show that FPNet achieves positioning accuracy above 97% with only 100 feedback bits, boosts net throughput by up to 22.92%, and attains AD accuracy over 99% with a false alarm rate below 1.5%.

As long as most of the scene remains static, probes approximate irradiance for all surfaces immersed in the irradiance volume, including novel dynamic objects. This approach, however, suffers from aliasing artifacts and high memory consumption. We propose Neural Irradiance Volume (NIV), a neural-based technique that allows accurate real-time rendering of diffuse global illumination via a compact pre-computed model, overcoming the limitations of traditional probe-based methods, such as the expensive memory footprint, aliasing artifacts, and scene-specific heuristics. The key insight is that neural compression creates an adaptive and amortized representation of irradiance, circumventing the cubic scaling of grid-based methods. Our superior memory-scaling improves quality by at least 10x at the same memory budget, and enables a straightforward representation of higher-dimensional irradiance fields, allowing rendering of time-varying or dynamic effects without requiring additional computation at runtime. Unlike other neural rendering techniques, our method works within strict real-time constraints, providing fast inference (around 1 ms per frame on consumer GPUs at full HD resolution), reduced memory usage (1-5 MB for medium-sized scenes), and only requires a G-buffer as input, without expensive ray tracing or denoising."}

Such spatial externalities - arising from proximity, clutter, or crowding - can significantly alter welfare and revenue outcomes, yet existing auction and allocation models typically treat ad slots as independent or ordered along a single dimension.\n  We introduce a new framework for spatial externalities in online advertising, in which the value of an ad depends on both its slot and the configuration of surrounding ads. We model ad slots as points in a metric space, and model an advertiser's value as a function of both their bid and a discount factor determined by the configuration of other displayed ads. Within this framework, we analyze two natural models. For the Nearest-Neighbor model, where the value suppression depends only on the closest neighboring ad, we present a polynomial-time algorithm that achieves a constant approximation for the general case. We show that the allocation rule is monotone and can be implemented as a truthful mechanism. For a structured setting of 2D Euclidean space, we provide a PTAS. In contrast, for the Product-Distance model, where interference is aggregated multiplicatively across all neighbors, we establish a strong (and nearly-tight) hardness of approximation - no polynomial-time algorithm can achieve any polynomial-factor approximation unless P=NP, via a reduction from Max-Independent-Set.\n  Our results provide a foundation for reasoning about spatial externalities in ad allocation and for designing efficient, truthful mechanisms under such interactions."}

Of note, recognizing the sociotechnical contexts in which these systems operate invites an opportunity for a deeper view of how multiple stakeholders and their unique priorities might inform what we consider meaningful or desirable model behavior. This paper introduces a theoretical framework that reconceptualizes benchmarking as a multilayer, adaptive network linking evaluation metrics, model components, and stakeholder groups through weighted interactions. Using conjoint-derived utilities and a human-in-the-loop update rule, we formalize how human tradeoffs can be embedded into benchmark structure and how benchmarks can evolve dynamically while preserving stability and interpretability. The resulting formulation generalizes classical leaderboards as a special case and provides a foundation for building evaluation protocols that are more context aware, resulting in new robust tools for analyzing the structural properties of benchmarks, which opens a path toward more accountable and human-aligned evaluation."}

Furthermore, prior methods typically convert motion into discrete representations via quantization to integrate with language models, introducing substantial jitter artifacts from discrete tokenization. To address these challenges, we propose LLaMo, a unified framework that extends pretrained LLMs through a modality-specific Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) architecture. This design inherently preserves the language understanding of the base model while enabling scalable multimodal adaptation. We encode human motion into a causal continuous latent space and maintain the next-token prediction paradigm in the decoder-only backbone through a lightweight flow-matching head, allowing for streaming motion generation in real-time (>30 FPS). Leveraging the comprehensive language understanding of pretrained LLMs and large-scale motion-text pretraining, our experiments demonstrate that LLaMo achieves high-fidelity text-to-motion generation and motion-to-text captioning in general settings, especially zero-shot motion generation, marking a significant step towards a general unified motion-language large model."}

However, most existing methods are stateless: they recompute entity representations at each timestamp from a limited query window, leading to episodic amnesia and rapid decay of long-term dependencies. To address this limitation, we propose Entity State Tuning (EST), an encoder-agnostic framework that endows TKG forecasters with persistent and continuously evolving entity states. EST maintains a global state buffer and progressively aligns structural evidence with sequential signals via a closed-loop design. Specifically, a topology-aware state perceiver first injects entity-state priors into structural encoding. Then, a unified temporal context module aggregates the state-enhanced events with a pluggable sequence backbone. Subsequently, a dual-track evolution mechanism writes the updated context back to the global entity state memory, balancing plasticity against stability. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that EST consistently improves diverse backbones and achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the importance of state persistence for long-horizon TKG forecasting.

Synthetic image detection (SID) has thus become an important area of research. Prior work has highlighted how synthetic images differ from real photographs--unfortunately, SID methods often struggle to generalize to novel generative models and often perform poorly in practical settings. CLIP, a foundational vision-language model which yields semantically rich image-text embeddings, shows strong accuracy and generalization for SID. Yet, the underlying relevant cues embedded in CLIP-features remain unknown. It is unclear, whether CLIP-based detectors simply detect strong visual artifacts or exploit subtle semantic biases, both of which would render them useless in practical settings or on generative models of high quality. We introduce SynthCLIC, a paired dataset of real photographs and high-quality synthetic counterparts from recent diffusion models, designed to reduce semantic bias in SID. Using an interpretable linear head with de-correlated activations and a text-grounded concept-model, we analyze what CLIP-based detectors learn. CLIP-based linear detectors reach 0.96 mAP on a GAN-based benchmark but only 0.92 on our high-quality diffusion dataset SynthCLIC, and generalization across generator families drops to as low as 0.37 mAP. We find that the detectors primarily rely on high-level photographic attributes (e.g., minimalist style, lens flare, or depth layering), rather than overt generator-specific artifacts. CLIP-based detectors perform well overall but generalize unevenly across diverse generative architectures. This highlights the need for continual model updates and broader training exposure, while reinforcing CLIP-based approaches as a strong foundation for more universal, robust SID."}

However, the unstructured and irregular nature of Gaussian point clouds poses challenges to reconstruction accuracy. This limitation frequently causes high-frequency detail loss in complex surface microstructures when relying solely on routine strategies. To address this limitation, we propose GSM-GS: a synergistic optimization framework integrating single-view adaptive sub-region weighting constraints and multi-view spatial structure refinement. For single-view optimization, we leverage image gradient features to partition scenes into texture-rich and texture-less sub-regions. The reconstruction quality is enhanced through adaptive filtering mechanisms guided by depth discrepancy features. This preserves high-weight regions while implementing a dual-branch constraint strategy tailored to regional texture variations, thereby improving geometric detail characterization. For multi-view optimization, we introduce a geometry-guided cross-view point cloud association method combined with a dynamic weight sampling strategy. This constructs 3D structural normal constraints across adjacent point cloud frames, effectively reinforcing multi-view consistency and reconstruction fidelity. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our method achieves both competitive rendering quality and geometric reconstruction. See our interactive project page"}

Although it is hard for a student to obtain an exact preference, she can usually compare specific features of colleges, such as reputation, location, and campus facilities. Motivated by this, we propose a feature-based uncertainty model for school choice where a student's preference is based on a linear combination of her utilities over different features, and the coefficients of the combination are treated as random variables. Our main goal is to achieve a higher probability of stability (ProS) and incentive compatibility (IC) for students. Unfortunately, these two goals are incompatible in general. We show that a student-proposing deferred acceptance (DA) that prioritizes colleges with higher expected ranking can achieve a worst-case approximation ratio of $(1/n)^n$ on ProS, while a DA with a carefully defined iterated comparison vector can guarantee the strongest achievable form of IC. Finally, we provide additional results for some specific restrictions on the model."}

The method claims that accurate spatial control can be achieved by optimizing a single diffusion latent at an intermediate timestep, together with identity-preserving fine-tuning and spatial regularization. This work presents a reproducibility study of DragDiffusion using the authors' released implementation and the DragBench benchmark. We reproduce the main ablation studies on diffusion timestep selection, LoRA-based fine-tuning, mask regularization strength, and UNet feature supervision, and observe close agreement with the qualitative and quantitative trends reported in the original work. At the same time, our experiments show that performance is sensitive to a small number of hyperparameter assumptions, particularly the optimized timestep and the feature level used for motion supervision, while other components admit broader operating ranges. We further evaluate a multi-timestep latent optimization variant and find that it does not improve spatial accuracy while substantially increasing computational cost.

To bridge the gap, we propose a Frankenstein-style analysis framework including: (i) functional localization via causal probing; (ii) update characterization via parameter comparison; and (iii) transferability test via model merging. Instead, RL induces a consistent inference-time shift primarily in mid-to-late layers, and these mid-to-late refinements are both transferable (via merging) and necessary (via freezing) for RL gains.

Sellers repeatedly set prices using simple learning rules and observe only their own prices and realized demand, even though demand depends on all sellers' prices and is subject to random shocks. Each seller runs two-point A/B price experiments, in the spirit of switchback-style designs, and updates a baseline price using a linear demand estimate fitted to its own data. Under certain conditions on demand, the resulting dynamics converge to a Conjectural Variations (CV) equilibrium, a classic static equilibrium notion in which each seller best responds under a conjecture that rivals' prices respond systematically to changes in its own price. Unlike standard CV models that treat conjectures as behavioral primitives, we show that these conjectures arise endogenously from the bias in demand learning induced by correlated experimentation (e.g., due to synchronized repricing schedules). This learning bias selects the long-run equilibrium, often leading to supra-competitive prices. Notably, we show that under independent experimentation, this bias vanishes and the learning dynamics converge to the standard Nash equilibrium. We provide simple sufficient conditions on demand for convergence in standard models and establish a finite-sample guarantee: up to logarithmic factors, the squared price error decays on the order of $T^{-1/2}$. Our results imply that in competitive markets, experimentation design can serve as a market design lever, selecting the equilibrium reached by practical learning algorithms."}

RankLLM introduces difficulty as the primary criterion for differentiation, enabling a more fine-grained evaluation of LLM capabilities. RankLLM's core mechanism facilitates bidirectional score propagation between models and questions.

In this paper, we identify spurious visual semantic correlations in existing generative ZSL worsened by scarce seen class samples and introduce two metrics to quantify spuriousness for seen and unseen classes. Furthermore, we point out a more critical bottleneck: existing unadaptive fully noised generators produce features disconnected from real test samples, which also leads to the spurious correlation. To enhance the visual-semantic correlations on both seen and unseen classes, we propose ZeroDiff++, a diffusion-based generative framework. In training, ZeroDiff++ uses (i) diffusion augmentation to produce diverse noised samples, (ii) supervised contrastive (SC) representations for instance level semantics, and (iii) multi view discriminators with Wasserstein mutual learning to assess generated features. At generation time, we introduce (iv) Diffusion-based Test time Adaptation (DiffTTA) to adapt the generator using pseudo label reconstruction, and (v) Diffusion-based Test time Generation (DiffGen) to trace the diffusion denoising path and produce partially synthesized features that connect real and generated data, and mitigates data scarcity further.

McDiffuSE uses look-ahead simulations to evaluate partial completions before commitment, systematically exploring the combinatorial space of generation orders. Experiments show an average improvement of 3.2% over autoregressive baselines and 8.0% over baseline plan-and-infill, with notable gains of 19.5% on MBPP and 4.9% on MATH500. Our analysis reveals that while McDiffuSE predominantly follows sequential ordering, incorporating non-sequential generation is essential for maximising performance. We observe that larger exploration constants, rather than increased simulations, are necessary to overcome model confidence biases and discover effective orderings. These findings establish MCTS-based planning as an effective approach for enhancing generation quality in MDMs."}

However, standard training objectives only weakly encourage this decomposition, and existing monosemanticity metrics require pairwise comparisons across all dataset samples, making them inefficient during training and evaluation. We study a recent MonoScore metric and derive a single-pass algorithm that computes exactly the same quantity, but with a cost that grows linearly, rather than quadratically, with the number of dataset images. On OpenImagesV7, we achieve up to a 1200x speedup wall-clock speedup in evaluation and 159x during training, while adding only ~4% per-epoch overhead. This allows us to treat MonoScore as a training signal: we introduce the Monosemanticity Loss (MonoLoss), a plug-in objective that directly rewards semantically consistent activations for learning interpretable monosemantic representations. Across SAEs trained on CLIP, SigLIP2, and pretrained ViT features, using BatchTopK, TopK, and JumpReLU SAEs, MonoLoss increases MonoScore for most latents. MonoLoss also consistently improves class purity (the fraction of a latent's activating images belonging to its dominant class) across all encoder and SAE combinations, with the largest gain raising baseline purity from 0.152 to 0.723. Used as an auxiliary regularizer during ResNet-50 and CLIP-ViT-B/32 finetuning, MonoLoss yields up to 0.6\\% accuracy gains on ImageNet-1K and monosemantic activating patterns on standard benchmark datasets.

At each round, the learner faces a seller-buyer pair and must propose a trade price without observing their private valuations for the item being sold. The goal of the learner is to post prices to facilitate trades between the two parties. Before posting a price, the learner observes a $d$-dimensional context vector that influences the agent's valuations. Prior work in the contextual setting has focused on linear models. In this work, we tackle a general nonparametric setting in which the buyer's and seller's valuations behave according to arbitrary Lipschitz functions of the context. We design an algorithm that leverages contextual information through a hierarchical tree construction and guarantees regret $\\widetilde{O}(T^{{(d-1)}/d})$. Remarkably, our algorithm operates under two stringent features of the setting: (1) one-bit feedback, where the learner only observes whether a trade occurred or not, and (2) strong budget balance, where the learner cannot subsidize or profit from the market participants. We further provide a matching lower bound in the full-feedback setting, demonstrating the tightness of our regret bound."}

Although rigorous, these approaches require large samples and may be constrained by data availability and cross-cultural comparability. Recent advances in natural language processing suggest that the semantic structure of questionnaire items may encode latent construct organization, offering a complementary response-free perspective. We introduce a topic-modeling framework that operationalizes semantic latent structure for scale simplification. Items are encoded using contextual sentence embeddings and grouped via density-based clustering to discover latent semantic factors without predefining their number. Class-based term weighting derives interpretable topic representations that approximate constructs and enable merging of semantically adjacent clusters. Representative items are selected using membership criteria within an integrated reduction pipeline. We benchmarked the framework across DASS, IPIP, and EPOCH, evaluating structural recovery, internal consistency, factor congruence, correlation preservation, and reduction efficiency. The proposed method recovered coherent factor-like groupings aligned with established constructs. Selected items reduced scale length by 60.5% on average while maintaining psychometric adequacy. Simplified scales showed high concordance with original factor structures and preserved inter-factor correlations, indicating that semantic latent organization provides a response-free approximation of measurement structure. Our framework formalizes semantic structure as an inspectable front-end for scale construction and reduction. To facilitate adoption, we provide a visualization-supported tool enabling one-click semantic analysis and structured simplification."}

To address these issues, we first introduce GeoSeek, a new geolocation dataset comprising CoT data annotated by geographic experts and professional players. We further thoroughly explore the inherent characteristics of geographic tasks and propose a geo-similarity reward and a consistency reward assessed by a consistency agent to assist training. This encourages the model to converge towards correct answers from a geographic perspective while ensuring the integrity and consistency of its reasoning process. Experimental results show that GeoAgent outperforms existing methods and a series of general VLLMs across multiple grains, while generating reasoning that closely aligns with humans."}

To this end, we introduce PathoSpatial, an interpretable end-to-end framework integrating co-registered WSIs and ST to learn spatially informed prognostic representations. PathoSpatial uses task-guided prototype learning within a multi-level experts architecture, adaptively orchestrating unsupervised within-modality discovery with supervised cross-modal aggregation. By design, PathoSpatial substantially strengthens interpretability while maintaining discriminative ability. We evaluate PathoSpatial on a triple-negative breast cancer cohort with paired ST and WSIs. PathoSpatial delivers strong and consistent performance across five survival endpoints, achieving superior or comparable performance to leading unimodal and multimodal methods. PathoSpatial inherently enables post-hoc prototype interpretation and molecular risk decomposition, providing quantitative, biologically grounded explanations, highlighting candidate prognostic factors.

This motivates us to study the problem of characterizing the complexity and memory requirements for two-player stochastic games with Boolean combinations of qualitative reachability and safety objectives. Reachability objectives require that a given set of states is reached; safety requires that a given set is invariant. A qualitative winning condition asks that an objective is satisfied almost surely (AS) or (in negated form) with non-zero (NZ) probability.\n  We study the determinacy and complexity landscape of the problem. We show that games with conjunctions of AS and NZ reachability and safety objectives are determined, and determining the winner is PSPACE-complete. The same holds for positive boolean combinations of AS reachability and safety, as well as for negations thereof. On the other hand, games with full Boolean combinations of qualitative objectives are not determined, and are NEXPTIME-hard. Our hardness results show a connection between stochastic games and logics with partially-ordered quantification. Our results shed light on the relationship between determinacy and complexity, and extend the complexity landscape for stochastic games in the multi-objective setting."}

However, such algorithms often rely on rigid modeling assumptions and can perform poorly when demand distributions shift or relevant contextual information is unavailable. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have generated interest in AI agents that can reason flexibly and incorporate rich contextual signals, but it remains unclear how best to incorporate LLM-based methods into traditional decision-making pipelines.\n  We study how OR algorithms, LLMs, and humans can interact and complement each other in a multi-period inventory control setting. We construct InventoryBench, a benchmark of over 1,000 inventory instances spanning both synthetic and real-world demand data, designed to stress-test decision rules under demand shifts, seasonality, and uncertain lead times. Through this benchmark, we find that OR-augmented LLM methods outperform either method in isolation, suggesting that these methods are complementary rather than substitutes.\n  We further investigate the role of humans through a controlled classroom experiment that embeds LLM recommendations into a human-in-the-loop decision pipeline. Contrary to prior findings that human-AI collaboration can degrade performance, we show that, on average, human-AI teams achieve higher profits than either humans or AI agents operating alone. Beyond this population-level finding, we formalize an individual-level complementarity effect and derive a distribution-free lower bound on the fraction of individuals who benefit from AI collaboration; empirically, we find this fraction to be substantial."}

However, it has been shown that the cosine similarity between a single image and a single hand-crafted template is insufficient to measure the similarity for image-text pairs. Building on this, in this paper, we find that the AEs generated using cosine similarity may fail to fool CLIP when the similarity metric is replaced with semantically enriched alternatives, making the image encoder fine-tuned with these AEs less robust. To overcome this issue, we first propose a semantic-ensemble attack to generate semantic-aware AEs by minimizing the average similarity between the original image and an ensemble of refined textual descriptions. These descriptions are initially generated by a foundation model to capture core semantic features beyond hand-crafted templates and are then refined to reduce hallucinations. To this end, we propose Semantic-aware Adversarial Fine-Tuning (SAFT), which fine-tunes CLIP's image encoder with semantic-aware AEs. Extensive experiments show that SAFT outperforms current methods, achieving substantial improvements in zero-shot adversarial robustness across 16 datasets.

In order to improve stylistic quality, a crucial first step is to establish a reliable evaluation method. However, having legal experts manually develop such a metric is impractical, as the implicit stylistic requirements in legal writing practice are difficult to formalise into explicit rubrics. Meanwhile, existing automatic evaluation methods also fall short: reference-based metrics conflate semantic accuracy with stylistic fidelity, and LLM-as-a-judge evaluations suffer from opacity and inconsistency. To address these challenges, we introduce CLASE (Chinese LegAlese Stylistic Evaluation), a hybrid evaluation method that focuses on the stylistic performance of legal text. The method incorporates a hybrid scoring mechanism that combines 1) linguistic feature-based scores and 2) experience-guided LLM-as-a-judge scores. Both the feature coefficients and the LLM scoring experiences are learned from contrastive pairs of authentic legal documents and their LLM-restored counterparts. This hybrid design captures both surface-level features and implicit stylistic norms in a transparent, reference-free manner. Experiments on 200 Chinese legal documents show that CLASE achieves substantially higher alignment with human judgments than traditional metrics and pure LLM-as-a-judge methods. Beyond improved alignment, CLASE provides interpretable score breakdowns and suggestions for improvements, offering a scalable and practical solution for professional stylistic evaluation in legal text generation (Code and data for CLASE is available at: https://github.com/rexera/CLASE)."}

In this paper, we introduce CogRouter, a framework that trains agents to dynamically adapt cognitive depth at each step. Grounded in ACT-R theory, we design four hierarchical cognitive levels ranging from instinctive responses to strategic planning. Our two-stage training approach includes Cognition-aware Supervised Fine-tuning (CoSFT) to instill stable level-specific patterns, and Cognition-aware Policy Optimization (CoPO) for step-level credit assignment via confidence-aware advantage reweighting.

The production and quality of grapes are significantly impacted by grape diseases such as Bacterial Rot, Downy Mildew, and Powdery Mildew. Consequently, the sustainable management of a vineyard necessitates the early and precise identification of these diseases. Current automated methods, particularly those that are based on the YOLO framework, are often computationally costly and lack interpretability that makes them unsuitable for real-world scenarios. This study proposes grape leaf disease classification using Optimized DenseNet 121. Domain-specific preprocessing and extensive connectivity reveal disease-relevant characteristics, including veins, edges, and lesions. An extensive comparison with baseline CNN models, including ResNet18, VGG16, AlexNet, and SqueezeNet, demonstrates that the proposed model exhibits superior performance. It achieves an accuracy of 99.27%, an F1 score of 99.28%, a specificity of 99.71%, and a Kappa of 98.86%, with an inference time of 9 seconds. The cross-validation findings show a mean accuracy of 99.12%, indicating strength and generalizability across all classes. We also employ Grad-CAM to highlight disease-related regions to guarantee the model is highlighting physiologically relevant aspects and increase transparency and confidence. Model optimization reduces processing requirements for real-time deployment, while transfer learning ensures consistency on smaller and unbalanced samples. An effective architecture, domain-specific preprocessing, and interpretable outputs make the proposed framework scalable, precise, and computationally inexpensive for detecting grape leaf diseases."}

Recent works address this issue by adopting GFlowNets, training LLMs to match a target distribution while jointly learning its partition function. In contrast to prior works that treat this partition function solely as a normalizer, we reinterpret it as a per-prompt expected-reward (i.e., online accuracy) signal, leveraging this unused information to improve sample efficiency. Specifically, we first establish a theoretical relationship between the partition function and per-prompt accuracy estimates. Building on this key insight, we propose Partition Function-Guided RL (PACED-RL), a post-training framework that leverages accuracy estimates to prioritize informative question prompts during training, and further improves sample efficiency through an accuracy estimate error-prioritized replay. Crucially, both components reuse information already produced during GFlowNet training, effectively amortizing the compute overhead into the existing optimization process. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate strong performance improvements over GRPO and prior GFlowNet approaches, highlighting PACED-RL as a promising direction for a more sample efficient distribution-matching training for LLMs."}

To address these challenges, we introduce a novel reward modeling paradigm: Probabilistic Reward Model (PRM). Instead of modeling reward as a deterministic scalar, our approach treats it as a random variable, learning a full probability distribution for the quality of each response. To make this paradigm practical, we present its closed-form, discrete realization: the Ordinal Probabilistic Reward Model (OPRM), which discretizes the quality score into a finite set of ordinal ratings. Building on OPRM, we propose a data-efficient training strategy called Region Flooding Tuning (RgFT). It enables rewards to better reflect absolute text quality by incorporating quality-level annotations, which guide the model to concentrate the probability mass within corresponding rating sub-regions. Experiments on various reward model benchmarks show that our method improves accuracy by $\\textbf{2.9%}\\sim\\textbf{7.4%}$ compared to prior reward models, demonstrating strong performance and data efficiency.

Our approach builds sequence correspondence by training a network to learn how to insert a slice from one sequence into the appropriate position in another. This is achieved by encoding contextual representations of each slice and modeling the insertion process using a slice-to-slice attention mechanism. We apply this method to localize manually labeled key slices in body CT scans and compare its performance to the current state-of-the-art alternative known as body part regression, which predicts anatomical position scores for individual slices. Unlike body part regression, which treats each slice independently, our method leverages contextual information from the entire sequence. Experimental results show that the insertion network reduces slice localization errors in supervised settings from 8.4 mm to 5.4 mm, demonstrating a substantial improvement in accuracy."}

While existing distillation approaches focus on imitating teacher behavior, they often overlook the original learning environment that shaped the teacher's knowledge. Inspired by the experiential learning theory and inverse reinforcement learning, we propose Experiential Knowledge Distillation ($\\mathcal{X}$-KD), a novel and general framework that enables student models to learn in the teacher's original learning environment. $\\mathcal{X}$-KD adopts the Approximated Variational Reward Imitation Learning (AVRIL) framework to jointly model the teacher's original reward function and perform policy distillation, encouraging consistency between the student policy and the original reward function. Our derivation demonstrates that $\\mathcal{X}$-KD follows the supervised learning framework and applies to both sequence-level and divergence-based distillation methods, underlining the simplicity and flexibility of our approach. Empirical results show that $\\mathcal{X}$-KD outperforms the generalized KD and MiniLLM baselines on abstractive summarization, machine translation, and arithmetic reasoning tasks.

We argue that operationalizing XAI requires treating explainability as an information systems problem where user interaction demands induce specific system requirements. We introduce X-SYS, a reference architecture for interactive explanation systems, that guides (X)AI researchers, developers and practitioners in connecting interactive explanation user interfaces (XUI) with system capabilities. X-SYS organizes around four quality attributes named STAR (scalability, traceability, responsiveness, and adaptability), and specifies a five-component decomposition (XUI Services, Explanation Services, Model Services, Data Services, Orchestration and Governance). It maps interaction patterns to system capabilities to decouple user interface evolution from backend computation. We implement X-SYS through SemanticLens, a system for semantic search and activation steering in vision-language models. SemanticLens demonstrates how contract-based service boundaries enable independent evolution, offline/online separation ensures responsiveness, and persistent state management supports traceability. Together, this work provides a reusable blueprint and concrete instantiation for interactive explanation systems supporting end-to-end design under operational constraints."}

To systematically characterize this limitation, we introduce a radiology-specific diagnostic benchmark that evaluates polarity sensitivity under controlled clinical conditions, revealing that common medical VLMs consistently confuse negated and non-negated findings. To enable learning beyond simple condition absence, we further construct a contextual clinical negation dataset that encodes structured claims and supports attribute-level negations involving location and severity. Building on these resources, we propose Negation-Aware Selective Training (NAST), an interpretability-guided adaptation method that uses causal tracing effects (CTEs) to modulate layer-wise gradient updates during fine-tuning. Rather than applying uniform learning rates, NAST scales each layer's update according to its causal contribution to negation processing, transforming mechanistic interpretability signals into a principled optimization rule. Experiments demonstrate improved discrimination of affirmative and negated clinical statements without degrading general vision-language alignment, highlighting the value of causal interpretability for targeted model adaptation in safety-critical medical settings.

To address this, we propose WebClipper, a framework that compresses web agent trajectories via graph-based pruning. Concretely, we model the agent's search process as a state graph and cast trajectory optimization as a minimum-necessary Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) mining problem, yielding pruned trajectories that preserve essential reasoning while eliminating redundant steps. Continued training on these refined trajectories enables the agent to evolve toward more efficient search patterns and reduces tool-call rounds by about 20% while improving accuracy. Furthermore, we introduce a new metric called F-AE Score to measure the model's overall performance in balancing accuracy and efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that WebClipper compresses tool-call rounds under excellent performance, providing practical insight into balancing effectiveness and efficiency in web agent design."}

These differences make precise image matching (co-registration) of these two types of images difficult. In this paper, we propose a new approach to image matching of optical and SAR images, which is based on transforming the images to a new modality. The new image modality is common to both optical and SAR images and satisfies the following conditions. First, the transformed images must have an equal pre-defined number of channels. Second, the transformed and co-registered images must be as similar as possible. Third, the transformed images must be non-degenerate, meaning they must preserve the significant features of the original images. To further match images transformed to this shared modality, we train the RoMa image matching model, which is one of the leading solutions for matching of regular digital photographs. We evaluated the proposed approach on the publicly available MultiSenGE dataset containing both optical and SAR images. We demonstrated its superiority over alternative approaches based on image translation between original modalities and various feature matching algorithms. The proposed solution not only provides better quality of matching, but is also more versatile. It enables the use of ready-made RoMa and DeDoDe models, pre-trained for regular images, without retraining for a new modality, while maintaining high-quality matching of optical and SAR images."}

Despite their effectiveness at modest retrieval scales, these methods often fail to scale gracefully as the number of retrieved candidates k increases: Larger k improves evidence coverage, yet realistic top-k retrieval inevitably contains irrelevant or redundant content and increases the inference cost.\n  To address these limitations, we propose ReFilter, a novel latent-based fusion framework that performs token-level filtering and fusion. ReFilter consists of three key components: a context encoder for encoding context features, a gated filter for weighting each token, and a token fusion module for integrating the weighted token feature into the LLM's hidden states. Our experiments across four general-domain QA benchmarks show that ReFilter consistently achieves the best average performance under both in-domain adaptation and out-of-domain transfer. ReFilter further generalizes to five biomedical QA benchmarks in zero-shot transfer without domain fine-tuning, reaching 70.01% average accuracy with Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct."}

We prove that observing a deterministic policy that is optimal for any non-constant reward function then conveys exactly $n \\log m$ bits of information about the environment.

This bound holds across a broad class of objectives, including finite-horizon, infinite-horizon discounted, and time-averaged reward maximization.

The key is to create test sets that, contrary to common practice, do not rely on gathering large amounts of real-world in-distribution scraped data, but consists in handcrafting a small set of linguistically motivated examples that exhaustively cover the range of span attributes (such as shape, length, casing, sentence position, etc.) a system may encounter in the wild.

These tools have traditionally been evaluated on their ability to remove specific identifiers (e.g., names), yet their effectiveness at preventing re-identification remains unclear. We introduce RAT-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for text anonymization tools based on re-identification risk. Using U.S. demographic statistics, we generate synthetic text containing various direct and indirect identifiers across domains, languages, and difficulty levels. We evaluate a range of NER- and LLM-based text anonymization tools and, based on the attributes an LLM-based attacker is able to correctly infer from the anonymized text, we report the risk of re-identification in the U.S. population, while properly accounting for the disparate impact of identifiers. We find that, while capabilities vary widely, even the best tools are far from perfect in particular when direct identifiers are not written in standard ways and when indirect identifiers enable re-identification. Overall we find LLM-based anonymizers, including new iterative anonymizers, to provide a better privacy-utility trade-off albeit at a higher computational cost.

Motivated by the limitations of classical optimal control under uncertainty and the need for interpretable decision making in safety critical aviation systems, we design a three stage Takagi Sugeno Kang fuzzy layer that modulates constraint radii, urgency levels, and activation decisions based on regulatory separation minima and airworthiness guidelines from FAA and EASA. These fuzzy-derived clearances are then incorporated as soft constraints into an optimal control problem solved using the FALCON toolbox and IPOPT. The framework aims to reduce unnecessary recomputations by selectively activating obstacle avoidance updates while maintaining compliance with aviation procedures. A proof of concept implementation using a simplified aircraft model demonstrates that the approach can generate optimal trajectories with computation times of 2,3 seconds per iteration in a single threaded MATLAB environment, suggesting feasibility for near real time applications. However, our experiments revealed a critical software incompatibility in the latest versions of FALCON and IPOPT, in which the Lagrangian penalty term remained identically zero, preventing proper constraint enforcement. This behavior was consistent across scenarios and indicates a solver toolbox regression rather than a modeling flaw. Future work includes validating this effect by reverting to earlier software versions, optimizing the fuzzy membership functions using evolutionary methods, and extending the system to higher fidelity aircraft models and stochastic obstacle environments."}

Our evaluation reveals that existing planning algorithms often show significant degradation under OOD appearance conditions, even when the underlying scene structure remains consistent. To bridge this gap, we propose a universal perception interface leveraging a frozen visual foundation model (DINOv3). By extracting appearance-invariant features as a stable interface for the planner, we achieve exceptional zero-shot generalization across diverse planning paradigms, including regression-based, diffusion-based, and scoring-based models. Our plug-and-play solution maintains consistent performance across extreme appearance shifts without requiring further fine-tuning. The benchmark and code will be made available."}

Moreover, it has been shown that, as the training of an LLM progresses, the performance in predicting brain activity from its internal activations improves more in the left hemisphere than in the right one. The aim of the present work is to understand which kind of competence acquired by the LLMs underlies the emergence of this left-right asymmetry. Using the OLMo-2 7B language model at various training checkpoints and fMRI data from English participants, we compare the evolution of the left-right asymmetry in brain scores alongside performance on several benchmarks. We observe that the asymmetry co-emerges with the formal linguistic abilities of the LLM. These abilities are demonstrated in two ways: by the model's capacity to assign a higher probability to an acceptable sentence than to a grammatically unacceptable one within a minimal contrasting pair, or its ability to produce well-formed text. On the opposite, the left-right asymmetry does not correlate with the performance on arithmetic or Dyck language tasks; nor with text-based tasks involving world knowledge and reasoning. We generalize these results to another family of LLMs (Pythia) and another language, namely French. Our observations indicate that the left-right asymmetry in brain predictivity matches the progress in formal linguistic competence (knowledge of linguistic patterns)."}

To leverage conventional image processing pipelines, events are typically binned into frames. However, binning functions are discontinuous, which truncates gradients at the frame level and forces most event-based algorithms to rely solely on frame-based features. Attempts to directly learn from raw events avoid this restriction but instead suffer from biased gradient estimation due to the discontinuities of the binning operation, ultimately limiting their learning efficiency. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework for unbiased gradient estimation of arbitrary binning functions by synthesizing weak derivatives during backpropagation while keeping the forward output unchanged. The key idea is to exploit integration by parts: lifting the target functions to functionals yields an integral form of the derivative of the binning function during backpropagation, where the cotangent function naturally arises. By reconstructing this cotangent function from the sampled cotangent vector, we compute weak derivatives that provably match long-range finite differences of both smooth and non-smooth targets. Experimentally, our method improves simple optimization-based egomotion estimation with 3.2\\% lower RMS error and 1.57$\\times$ faster convergence. On complex downstream tasks, we achieve 9.4\\% lower EPE in self-supervised optical flow, and 5.1\\% lower RMS error in SLAM, demonstrating broad benefits for event-based visual perception.

In this work, we address Subtask B of the MultiPRIDE shared task at EVALITA 2026 by proposing a hierarchical approach to modeling the slur reclamation process. Our core assumption is that members of the LGBTQ+ community are more likely, on average, to employ certain slurs in a eclamatory manner. Based on this hypothesis, we decompose the task into two stages. First, using a weakly supervised LLM-based annotation, we assign fuzzy labels to users indicating the likelihood of belonging to the LGBTQ+ community, inferred from the tweet and the user bio. These soft labels are then used to train a BERT-like model to predict community membership, encouraging the model to learn latent representations associated with LGBTQ+ identity. In the second stage, we integrate this latent space with a newly initialized model for the downstream slur reclamation detection task. The intuition is that the first model encodes user-oriented sociolinguistic signals, which are then fused with representations learned by a model pretrained for hate speech detection. Experimental results on Italian and Spanish show that our approach achieves performance statistically comparable to a strong BERT-based baseline, while providing a modular and extensible framework for incorporating sociolinguistic context into hate speech modeling. We argue that more fine-grained hierarchical modeling of user identity and discourse context may further improve the detection of reclaimed language.

Prior pruning methods operate either before the LLM, limiting generality due to diverse encoder-projector designs or within the LLM using heuristics that are incompatible with FlashAttention. We take a different approach: rather than identifying unimportant tokens, we treat the LLM itself as the optimal guide for compression. Observing that deeper layers naturally transmit vision-to-text information, we introduce Attention-Driven Self-Compression (ADSC), a simple, broadly applicable method that progressively reduces vision tokens using only the LLM's attention mechanism. Our method applies uniform token downsampling at selected layers, forming bottlenecks that encourage the model to reorganize and compress information into the remaining tokens. It requires no score computation, auxiliary modules, or attention modification, and remains fully compatible with FlashAttention. Applied to LLaVA-1.5, ADSC reduces FLOPs by 53.7% and peak KV-cache memory by 56.7%, while preserving 98.2% of the original model performance. Across multiple benchmarks, it outperforms prior pruning approaches in both efficiency and accuracy.

However, their iterative sampling process, which gradually morphs random noise into coherent images, introduces significant latency that limits their applicability. While recent few-step diffusion models reduce the number of sampling steps to as few as one to four steps, they often compromise image quality and prompt alignment, especially in one-step generation. Additionally, these models require computationally expensive training procedures. To address these limitations, we propose ImageRAGTurbo, a novel approach to efficiently finetune few-step diffusion models via retrieval augmentation. Given a text prompt, we retrieve relevant text-image pairs from a database and use them to condition the generation process. We argue that such retrieved examples provide rich contextual information to the UNet denoiser that helps reduce the number of denoising steps without compromising image quality. Indeed, our initial investigations show that using the retrieved content to edit the denoiser's latent space ($\\mathcal{H}$-space) without additional finetuning already improves prompt fidelity. To further improve the quality of the generated images, we augment the UNet denoiser with a trainable adapter in the $\\mathcal{H}$-space, which efficiently blends the retrieved content with the target prompt using a cross-attention mechanism. Experimental results on fast text-to-image generation demonstrate that our approach produces high-fidelity images without compromising latency compared to existing methods."}

In MTL, learned skip weights exhibit systematic task-aware redistribution: shallow skips favor reconstruction, while deeper features support discrimination.

Instead, RL induces a consistent inference-time shift primarily in mid-to-late layers, and these mid-to-late refinements are both transferable (via merging) and necessary (via freezing) for RL gains.

However, in the literature cloudless analysis is often performed where cloudy images are excluded from machine learning datasets and methods. Such an approach cannot be applied to time sensitive applications, e.g., during natural disasters. A possible solution is to apply cloud removal as a preprocessing step to ensure that cloudfree solutions are not failing under such conditions. But cloud removal methods are still actively researched and suffer from drawbacks, such as generated visual artifacts. Therefore, it is desirable to develop cloud robust methods that are less affected by cloudy weather. Cloud robust methods can be achieved by combining optical data with radar, a modality unaffected by clouds. While many datasets for machine learning combine optical and radar data, most researchers exclude cloudy images. We identify this exclusion from machine learning training and evaluation as a limitation that reduces applicability to cloudy scenarios. To investigate this, we assembled a dataset, named CloudyBigEarthNet (CBEN), of paired optical and radar images with cloud occlusion for training and evaluation. Using average precision (AP) as the evaluation metric, we show that state-of-the-art methods trained on combined clear-sky optical and radar imagery suffer performance drops of 23-33 percentage points when evaluated on cloudy images.

RankLLM's core mechanism facilitates bidirectional score propagation between models and questions. The core intuition of RankLLM is that a model earns a competency score when it correctly answers a question, while a question's difficulty score increases when it challenges a model. Using this framework, we evaluate 30 models on 35,550 questions across multiple domains. RankLLM achieves 90% agreement with human judgments and consistently outperforms strong baselines such as IRT. It also exhibits strong stability, fast convergence, and high computational efficiency, making it a practical solution for large-scale, difficulty-aware LLM evaluation."}

Existing fairness-aware datasets have significantly improved demographic balance across global race and gender groups, yet they continue to treat Indian as a single monolithic category. The oversimplification ignores the vast intra-national diversity across 28 states and 8 Union Territories of India and leads to representational and geographical bias. To address the limitation, we present IndicFairFace, a novel and balanced face dataset comprising 14,400 images representing geographical diversity of India. Images were sourced ethically from Wikimedia Commons and open-license web repositories and uniformly balanced across states and gender. Using IndicFairFace, we quantify intra-national geographical bias in prominent CLIP-based VLMs and reduce it using post-hoc Iterative Nullspace Projection debiasing approach. We also show that the adopted debiasing approach does not adversely impact the existing embedding space as the average drop in retrieval accuracy on benchmark datasets is less than 1.5 percent. Our work establishes IndicFairFace as the first benchmark to study geographical bias in VLMs for the Indian context."}

While automated probing has been enabled by dynamic test generation, existing approaches often discover isolated failure cases, lack principled control over exploration, and provide limited insight into the underlying structure of model weaknesses. We propose ProbeLLM, a benchmark-agnostic automated probing framework that elevates weakness discovery from individual failures to structured failure modes. ProbeLLM formulates probing as a hierarchical Monte Carlo Tree Search, explicitly allocating limited probing budgets between global exploration of new failure regions and local refinement of recurring error patterns. By restricting probing to verifiable test cases and leveraging tool-augmented generation and verification, ProbeLLM grounds failure discovery in reliable evidence. Discovered failures are further consolidated into interpretable failure modes via failure-aware embeddings and boundary-aware induction. Across diverse benchmarks and LLMs, ProbeLLM reveals substantially broader, cleaner, and more fine-grained failure landscapes than static benchmarks and prior automated methods, supporting a shift from case-centric evaluation toward principled weakness discovery."}

The production and quality of grapes are significantly impacted by grape diseases such as Bacterial Rot, Downy Mildew, and Powdery Mildew. Consequently, the sustainable management of a vineyard necessitates the early and precise identification of these diseases. Current automated methods, particularly those that are based on the YOLO framework, are often computationally costly and lack interpretability that makes them unsuitable for real-world scenarios. This study proposes grape leaf disease classification using Optimized DenseNet 121. Domain-specific preprocessing and extensive connectivity reveal disease-relevant characteristics, including veins, edges, and lesions. An extensive comparison with baseline CNN models, including ResNet18, VGG16, AlexNet, and SqueezeNet, demonstrates that the proposed model exhibits superior performance. It achieves an accuracy of 99.27%, an F1 score of 99.28%, a specificity of 99.71%, and a Kappa of 98.86%, with an inference time of 9 seconds. The cross-validation findings show a mean accuracy of 99.12%, indicating strength and generalizability across all classes. We also employ Grad-CAM to highlight disease-related regions to guarantee the model is highlighting physiologically relevant aspects and increase transparency and confidence. Model optimization reduces processing requirements for real-time deployment, while transfer learning ensures consistency on smaller and unbalanced samples. An effective architecture, domain-specific preprocessing, and interpretable outputs make the proposed framework scalable, precise, and computationally inexpensive for detecting grape leaf diseases."}

Project page: https://vvsjeon.github.io/MPD/", "summary": "Recent progress in image-to-video (I2V) diffusion models has significantly advanced the field of generative inbetweening, which aims to generate semantically plausible frames between two keyframes. In particular, inference-time sampling strategies, which leverage the generative priors of large-scale pre-trained I2V models without additional training, have become increasingly popular. However, existing inference-time sampling, either fusing forward and backward paths in parallel or alternating them sequentially, often suffers from temporal discontinuities and undesirable visual artifacts due to the misalignment between the two generated paths. This is because each path follows the motion prior induced by its own conditioning frame. In this work, we propose Motion Prior Distillation (MPD), a simple yet effective inference-time distillation technique that suppresses bidirectional mismatch by distilling the motion residual of the forward path into the backward path. Our method can deliberately avoid denoising the end-conditioned path which causes the ambiguity of the path, and yield more temporally coherent inbetweening results with the forward motion prior. We not only perform quantitative evaluations on standard benchmarks, but also conduct extensive user studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in practical scenarios."}

Using a time-to-collision (TTC) behavioral paradigm, we introduce a comparison pipeline and alignment metric, then vary model training time, size, and effective capacity via pruning. Across all manipulations, alignment with human behavior follows an inverse U-shaped curve: small/briefly trained/pruned models under-segment into blobs; large/fully trained models over-segment with boundary wiggles; and an intermediate ideal body granularity'' best matches humans. This suggests human-like coarse bodies emerge from resource constraints rather than bespoke biases, and points to simple knobs - early checkpoints, modest architectures, light pruning - for eliciting physics-efficient representations. We situate these results within resource-rational accounts balancing recognition detail against physical affordances."}

Prior work trains MCI encoders but typically evaluates them via full fine-tuning, leaving probing with frozen pre-trained encoders comparatively underexplored. Existing studies that perform probing largely focus on improving representations, rather than how to best leverage fixed representations for downstream tasks. Although the latter problem has been studied in other domains, directly transferring those strategies to MCI yields weak results, even worse than training from scratch. We therefore propose Channel-Aware Probing (CAP), which exploits the intrinsic inter-channel diversity in MCI datasets by controlling feature flow at both the encoder and probe levels. CAP uses Independent Feature Encoding (IFE) to encode each channel separately, and Decoupled Pooling (DCP) to pool within channels before aggregating across channels. Across three MCI benchmarks, CAP consistently improves probing performance over the default probing protocol, matches fine-tuning from scratch, and largely reduces the gap to full fine-tuning from the same MCI pre-trained checkpoints.

Contrarily to keyphrase extraction approaches, keyphrase generation models can predict keyphrases that do not appear in a document's text called `absent keyphrases`. This ability means that keyphrase generation models can associate a document to a notion that is not explicitly mentioned in its text. Intuitively, this suggests that for two documents treating the same subjects, a keyphrase generation model is more likely to be homogeneous in their indexing i.e. predict the same keyphrase for both documents, regardless of those keyphrases appearing in their respective text or not; something a keyphrase extraction model would fail to do. Yet, homogeneity of keyphrase prediction models is not covered by current benchmarks. In this work, we introduce a method to evaluate the homogeneity of keyphrase prediction models and study if absent keyphrase generation capabilities actually help the model to be more homogeneous. To our surprise, we show that keyphrase extraction methods are competitive with generative models, and that the ability to generate absent keyphrases can actually have a negative impact on homogeneity.

Prior pruning methods operate either before the LLM, limiting generality due to diverse encoder-projector designs or within the LLM using heuristics that are incompatible with FlashAttention.

Observing that deeper layers naturally transmit vision-to-text information, we introduce Attention-Driven Self-Compression (ADSC), a simple, broadly applicable method that progressively reduces vision tokens using only the LLM's attention mechanism. Our method applies uniform token downsampling at selected layers, forming bottlenecks that encourage the model to reorganize and compress information into the remaining tokens. It requires no score computation, auxiliary modules, or attention modification, and remains fully compatible with FlashAttention.

To bridge this gap, we introduce VimRAG, a framework tailored for multimodal Retrieval-augmented Reasoning across text, images, and videos. Inspired by our systematic study, we model the reasoning process as a dynamic directed acyclic graph that structures the agent states and retrieved multimodal evidence. Building upon this structured memory, we introduce a Graph-Modulated Visual Memory Encoding mechanism, with which the significance of memory nodes is evaluated via their topological position, allowing the model to dynamically allocate high-resolution tokens to pivotal evidence while compressing or discarding trivial clues.

This study examines the trustworthiness of AI models, specifically the presence of bias, in detecting healthy multilingual English speakers among the cognitively impaired cohort, to make these tools clinically beneficial. For experiments, monolingual participants were recruited nationally (UK), and multilingual speakers were enrolled from four community centres in Sheffield and Bradford. In addition to a non-native English accent, multilinguals spoke Somali, Chinese, or South Asian languages, who were further divided into two Yorkshire accents (West and South) to challenge the efficiency of the AI tools thoroughly. Although ASR systems showed no significant bias across groups, classification and regression models using acoustic and linguistic features exhibited bias against multilingual speakers, particularly in memory, fluency, and reading tasks. This bias was more pronounced when models were trained on the publicly available DementiaBank dataset. Moreover, multilinguals were more likely to be misclassified as having cognitive decline. This study is the first of its kind to discover that, despite their strong overall performance, current AI models show bias against multilingual individuals from ethnic minority backgrounds in the UK, and they are also more likely to misclassify speakers with a certain accent (South Yorkshire) as living with a more severe cognitive decline. In this pilot study, we conclude that the existing AI tools are therefore not yet reliable for diagnostic use in these populations, and we aim to address this in future work by developing more generalisable, bias-mitigated models."}

Specifically, we first establish a theoretical relationship between the partition function and per-prompt accuracy estimates. Building on this key insight, we propose Partition Function-Guided RL (PACED-RL), a post-training framework that leverages accuracy estimates to prioritize informative question prompts during training, and further improves sample efficiency through an accuracy estimate error-prioritized replay. Crucially, both components reuse information already produced during GFlowNet training, effectively amortizing the compute overhead into the existing optimization process. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate strong performance improvements over GRPO and prior GFlowNet approaches, highlighting PACED-RL as a promising direction for a more sample efficient distribution-matching training for LLMs."}

Instead of merely automating isolated steps, we reconstruct the workflow by decomposing expert practices into structured computational components. Specifically, we leverage LLMs to extract behavioral and psychological descriptions from raw textual data and map them to predefined competency libraries through embedding-based similarity. We further introduce a learnable parameter that adaptively integrates different information sources, enabling the model to determine the relative importance of behavioral and psychological signals.

Overall, our framework transforms competency modeling from a largely qualitative and expert-dependent practice into a transparent, data-driven, and evaluable analytical process."}

By replacing concatenative skips with gated additive fusion, the proposed Additive U-Net (AddUNet) constrains shortcut capacity while preserving fixed feature dimensionality across depth. This structural regularization induces controlled encoder-decoder information flow and stabilizes joint optimization. Across single-task denoising and joint denoising-classification settings, AddUNet achieves competitive reconstruction performance with improved training stability. In MTL, learned skip weights exhibit systematic task-aware redistribution: shallow skips favor reconstruction, while deeper features support discrimination. Notably, reconstruction remains robust even under limited classification capacity, indicating implicit task decoupling through additive fusion. These findings show that simple constraints on skip connections act as an effective architectural regularizer for stable and scalable multi-task learning without increasing model complexity."}

Yet most prior work targets whole brain age (WBA), a coarse paradigm that struggles to support tasks such as disease characterization and research on development and aging patterns, because relevant changes are typically region-selective rather than brain-wide. Therefore, robust regional brain age (ReBA) estimation is critical, yet a widely generalizable model has yet to be established. In this paper, we propose the Regional Brain Age Prediction Network (ReBA-Pred-Net), a Teacher-Student framework designed for fine-grained brain age estimation. The Teacher produces soft ReBA to guide the Student to yield reliable ReBA estimates with a clinical-prior consistency constraint (regions within the same function should change similarly). For rigorous evaluation, we introduce two indirect metrics: Healthy Control Similarity (HCS), which assesses statistical consistency by testing whether regional brain-age-gap (ReBA minus chronological age) distributions align between training and unseen HC; and Neuro Disease Correlation (NDC), which assesses factual consistency by checking whether clinically confirmed patients show elevated brain-age-gap in disease-associated regions. Experiments across multiple backbones demonstrate the statistical and factual validity of our method."}

Various linguistic properties of the training data were analyzed to identify relevant proficiency predictors associated with increasing complexity and correctness, rather than the writing task. Such lexical, morphological, surface, and error features were used to train classification models, which were compared to models that also allowed for other features. The pre-selected features yielded a similar test accuracy but reduced variation in the classification of different text types. The best classifiers achieved an accuracy of around 0.9.

Using IndicFairFace, we quantify intra-national geographical bias in prominent CLIP-based VLMs and reduce it using post-hoc Iterative Nullspace Projection debiasing approach.

As most studies consider synthetic data, it is not clear whether training data mismatch (``domain shift'') or forward model mismatch complicate their successful application to experimental data. We measured CT data from a physical phantom resembling the synthetic Shepp-Logan phantom and trained diffusion priors on synthetic image data sets with different degrees of domain shift towards it. Then, we employed the priors in a Decomposed Diffusion Sampling scheme on sparse-view CT data sets with increasing difficulty leading to the experimental data. Our results reveal that domain shift plays a nuanced role: while severe mismatch causes model collapse and hallucinations, diverse priors outperform well-matched but narrow priors. Forward model mismatch pulls the image samples away from the prior manifold, which causes artifacts but can be mitigated with annealed likelihood schedules that also increase computational efficiency. Overall, we demonstrate that performance gains do not immediately translate from synthetic to experimental data, and future development must validate against real-world benchmarks."}

Under exchangeability, SCOPE calibrates an acceptance threshold such that the error rate among non-abstained judgments is at most a user-specified level $α$. To provide SCOPE with a bias-neutral uncertainty signal, we introduce Bidirectional Preference Entropy (BPE), which queries the judge under both response positions, aggregates the implied preference probabilities to enforce invariance to response order, and converts the aggregated probability into an entropy-based uncertainty score. Across MT-Bench, RewardBench, and Chatbot Arena, BPE improves uncertainty quality over standard confidence proxies, providing a stronger selection signal that enables SCOPE to consistently meet the target risk level while retaining good coverage across judge scales. In particular, at $α= 0.10$, \\textsc{Scope} consistently satisfies the risk bound across all benchmarks and judge scales (empirical risk $\\approx 0.097$ to $0.099$), while retaining substantial coverage, reaching $0.89$ on RewardBench with Qwen-14B and $0.98$ on RewardBench with Qwen-32B.

Extending this methodology to contextual embeddings in addition to static ones and applying it to a new corpus of Twitter posts, we show that the same findings hold for both domains, though the topic popularity growth factor may contribute less to neology on Twitter than in published writing.

We introduce RAT-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for text anonymization tools based on re-identification risk. Using U.S. demographic statistics, we generate synthetic text containing various direct and indirect identifiers across domains, languages, and difficulty levels. We evaluate a range of NER- and LLM-based text anonymization tools and, based on the attributes an LLM-based attacker is able to correctly infer from the anonymized text, we report the risk of re-identification in the U.S. population, while properly accounting for the disparate impact of identifiers. We find that, while capabilities vary widely, even the best tools are far from perfect in particular when direct identifiers are not written in standard ways and when indirect identifiers enable re-identification. Overall we find LLM-based anonymizers, including new iterative anonymizers, to provide a better privacy-utility trade-off albeit at a higher computational cost. Importantly, we also find them to work well across languages. We conclude with recommendations for future anonymization tools and will release the benchmark and encourage community efforts to expand it, in particular to other geographies."}

In this paper, we present PixelRush, the first tuning-free framework for practical high-resolution text-to-image generation. Our method builds upon the established patch-based inference paradigm but eliminates the need for multiple inversion and regeneration cycles. Instead, PixelRush enables efficient patch-based denoising within a low-step regime. To address artifacts introduced by patch blending in few-step generation, we propose a seamless blending strategy. Furthermore, we mitigate over-smoothing effects through a noise injection mechanism. PixelRush delivers exceptional efficiency, generating 4K images in approximately 20 seconds representing a 10$\\times$ to 35$\\times$ speedup over state-of-the-art methods while maintaining superior visual fidelity.

In this work we extend the OpenLID classifier by adding more training data, merging problematic language variant clusters, and introducing a special label for marking noise. We call this extended system OpenLID-v3 and evaluate it against GlotLID on multiple benchmarks.

Moreover, it has been shown that, as the training of an LLM progresses, the performance in predicting brain activity from its internal activations improves more in the left hemisphere than in the right one. The aim of the present work is to understand which kind of competence acquired by the LLMs underlies the emergence of this left-right asymmetry. Using the OLMo-2 7B language model at various training checkpoints and fMRI data from English participants, we compare the evolution of the left-right asymmetry in brain scores alongside performance on several benchmarks. We observe that the asymmetry co-emerges with the formal linguistic abilities of the LLM. These abilities are demonstrated in two ways: by the model's capacity to assign a higher probability to an acceptable sentence than to a grammatically unacceptable one within a minimal contrasting pair, or its ability to produce well-formed text. On the opposite, the left-right asymmetry does not correlate with the performance on arithmetic or Dyck language tasks; nor with text-based tasks involving world knowledge and reasoning. We generalize these results to another family of LLMs (Pythia) and another language, namely French. Our observations indicate that the left-right asymmetry in brain predictivity matches the progress in formal linguistic competence (knowledge of linguistic patterns)."}

Fully-supervised counting methods require costly point-level annotations per object. Few weakly-supervised methods leverage only image-level object counts as supervision and achieve fairly promising results. They are, however, often limited to counting a single category, e.g. person. In this paper, we propose WS-COC, the first MLLM-driven weakly-supervised framework for class-agnostic object counting. Instead of directly fine-tuning MLLMs to predict object counts, which can be challenging due to the modality gap, we incorporate three simple yet effective strategies to bootstrap the counting paradigm in both training and testing: First, a divide-and-discern dialogue tuning strategy is proposed to guide the MLLM to determine whether the object count falls within a specific range and progressively break down the range through multi-round dialogue. Second, a compare-and-rank count optimization strategy is introduced to train the MLLM to optimize the relative ranking of multiple images according to their object counts. Third, a global-and-local counting enhancement strategy aggregates and fuses local and global count predictions to improve counting performance in dense scenes. Extensive experiments on FSC-147, CARPK, PUCPR+, and ShanghaiTech show that WS-COC matches or even surpasses many state-of-art fully-supervised methods while significantly reducing annotation costs.

This entropy rate implies that English contains nearly 80 percent redundancy relative to the five bits per character expected for random text. We introduce a statistical model that attempts to capture the intricate multi-scale structure of natural language, providing a first-principles account of this redundancy level. Our model describes a procedure of self-similarly segmenting text into semantically coherent chunks down to the single-word level. The semantic structure of the text can then be hierarchically decomposed, allowing for analytical treatment. Numerical experiments with modern LLMs and open datasets suggest that our model quantitatively captures the structure of real texts at different levels of the semantic hierarchy. The entropy rate predicted by our model agrees with the estimated entropy rate of printed English. Moreover, our theory further reveals that the entropy rate of natural language is not fixed but should increase systematically with the semantic complexity of corpora, which are captured by the only free parameter in our model."}

Meanwhile, common pre-training metrics cannot quantify a model's perception and reasoning abilities in a disentangled manner. Furthermore, existing evaluation benchmarks are typically limited in scale or misaligned with pre-training objectives. Thus, we propose RADAR, an efficient ability-centric evaluation framework for Revealing Asymmetric Development of Abilities in MLLM pRe-training. RADAR involves two key components: (1) Soft Discrimination Score, a novel metric for robustly tracking ability development without fine-tuning, based on quantifying nuanced gradations of the model preference for the correct answer over distractors; and (2) Multi-Modal Mixture Benchmark, a new 15K+ sample benchmark for comprehensively evaluating pre-trained MLLMs' perception and reasoning abilities in a 0-shot manner, where we unify authoritative benchmark datasets and carefully collect new datasets, extending the evaluation scope and addressing the critical gaps in current benchmarks. With RADAR, we comprehensively reveal the asymmetric development of perceptual and reasoning capabilities in pretrained MLLMs across diverse factors, including data volume, model size, and pretraining strategy.

To address this limitation, we propose GSM-GS: a synergistic optimization framework integrating single-view adaptive sub-region weighting constraints and multi-view spatial structure refinement. For single-view optimization, we leverage image gradient features to partition scenes into texture-rich and texture-less sub-regions. The reconstruction quality is enhanced through adaptive filtering mechanisms guided by depth discrepancy features. This preserves high-weight regions while implementing a dual-branch constraint strategy tailored to regional texture variations, thereby improving geometric detail characterization. For multi-view optimization, we introduce a geometry-guided cross-view point cloud association method combined with a dynamic weight sampling strategy. This constructs 3D structural normal constraints across adjacent point cloud frames, effectively reinforcing multi-view consistency and reconstruction fidelity.

This paper proposes a method for evaluating the robustness of object detection ML models in autonomous vehicles under adverse weather conditions. It employs data augmentation operators to generate synthetic data that simulates different severance degrees of the adverse operation conditions at progressive intensity levels to find the lowest intensity of the adverse conditions at which the object detection model fails. The robustness of the object detection model is measured by the average first failure coefficients (AFFC) over the input images in the benchmark. The paper reports an experiment with four object detection models: YOLOv5s, YOLOv11s, Faster R-CNN, and Detectron2, utilising seven data augmentation operators that simulate weather conditions fog, rain, and snow, and lighting conditions of dark, bright, flaring, and shadow. The experiment data show that the method is feasible, effective, and efficient to evaluate and compare the robustness of object detection models in various adverse operation conditions. In particular, the Faster R-CNN model achieved the highest robustness with an overall average AFFC of 71.9% over all seven adverse conditions, while YOLO variants showed the AFFC values of 43%. The method is also applied to assess the impact of model training that targets adverse operation conditions using synthetic data on model robustness. It is observed that such training can improve robustness in adverse conditions but may suffer from diminishing returns and forgetting phenomena (i.e., decline in robustness) if overtrained."}

Motivated by the interleaved nature of radiological diagnosis, we introduce MMRad-IVL-22K, the first large-scale dataset designed for natively interleaved visual language reasoning in chest X-ray interpretation. MMRad-IVL-22K reflects a repeated cycle of reasoning and visual inspection workflow of radiologists, in which visual rationales complement textual descriptions and ground each step of the reasoning process. MMRad-IVL-22K comprises 21,994 diagnostic traces, enabling systematic scanning across 35 anatomical regions. Experimental results on advanced closed-source LVLMs demonstrate that report generation guided by multimodal CoT significantly outperforms that guided by text-only CoT in clinical accuracy and report quality (e.g., 6\\% increase in the RadGraph metric), confirming that high-fidelity interleaved vision language evidence is a non-substitutable component of reliable medical AI. Furthermore, benchmarking across seven state-of-the-art open-source LVLMs demonstrates that models fine-tuned on MMRad-IVL-22K achieve superior reasoning consistency and report quality compared with both general-purpose and medical-specific LVLMs. The project page is available at https://github.com/qiuzyc/thinking_like_a_radiologist."}

However, most existing methods are stateless: they recompute entity representations at each timestamp from a limited query window, leading to episodic amnesia and rapid decay of long-term dependencies. To address this limitation, we propose Entity State Tuning (EST), an encoder-agnostic framework that endows TKG forecasters with persistent and continuously evolving entity states. EST maintains a global state buffer and progressively aligns structural evidence with sequential signals via a closed-loop design. Specifically, a topology-aware state perceiver first injects entity-state priors into structural encoding. Then, a unified temporal context module aggregates the state-enhanced events with a pluggable sequence backbone. Subsequently, a dual-track evolution mechanism writes the updated context back to the global entity state memory, balancing plasticity against stability. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that EST consistently improves diverse backbones and achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the importance of state persistence for long-horizon TKG forecasting.

EPRBench comprises 10K event sequences and 65K event frames, collected using both handheld and vehicle-mounted setups to comprehensively capture real-world challenges across diverse viewpoints, weather conditions, and lighting scenarios.

Prior pruning methods operate either before the LLM, limiting generality due to diverse encoder-projector designs or within the LLM using heuristics that are incompatible with FlashAttention. We take a different approach: rather than identifying unimportant tokens, we treat the LLM itself as the optimal guide for compression. Observing that deeper layers naturally transmit vision-to-text information, we introduce Attention-Driven Self-Compression (ADSC), a simple, broadly applicable method that progressively reduces vision tokens using only the LLM's attention mechanism. Our method applies uniform token downsampling at selected layers, forming bottlenecks that encourage the model to reorganize and compress information into the remaining tokens. It requires no score computation, auxiliary modules, or attention modification, and remains fully compatible with FlashAttention. Applied to LLaVA-1.5, ADSC reduces FLOPs by 53.7% and peak KV-cache memory by 56.7%, while preserving 98.2% of the original model performance. Across multiple benchmarks, it outperforms prior pruning approaches in both efficiency and accuracy. Crucially, under high compression ratios, our method remains robust while heuristic-based techniques degrade sharply."}

We propose a fully differentiable, deep-learning-based deformable registration framework that aligns individual pathological brains to a common atlas while preserving metastatic tissue without requiring lesion masks or preprocessing.\n  Missing anatomical correspondences caused by metastases are handled through a forward-model similarity metric based on distance-transformed anatomical labels, combined with a volume-preserving regularization term to ensure deformation plausibility. Registration performance was evaluated using Dice coefficient (DSC), Hausdorff distance (HD), average symmetric surface distance (ASSD), and Jacobian-based measures. The method was applied to 209 MBM patients from three centres, enabling standardized mapping of metastases to anatomical, arterial, and perfusion atlases.\n  The framework achieved high registration accuracy across datasets (DSC 0.89-0.92, HD 6.79-7.60 mm, ASSD 0.63-0.77 mm) while preserving metastatic volumes. Spatial analysis demonstrated significant over-representation of MBM in the cerebral cortex and putamen, under-representation in white matter, and consistent localization near the gray-white matter junction. No arterial territory showed increased metastasis frequency after volume correction.\n  This approach enables robust atlas registration of pathological brain MRI without lesion masks and supports reproducible multi-centre analyses. Applied to MBM, it confirms and refines known spatial predilections, particularly preferential seeding near the gray-white matter junction and cortical regions.

In this paper, we introduce CogRouter, a framework that trains agents to dynamically adapt cognitive depth at each step. Grounded in ACT-R theory, we design four hierarchical cognitive levels ranging from instinctive responses to strategic planning.

Deployed tracking systems usually lack formal safety assurances to convey when tracking is reliable and when it may fail, at best relying on heuristic measures of model confidence to raise alerts. To obtain such assurances we propose interpreting object tracking as a sequential hypothesis test, wherein evidence for or against tracking failures is gradually accumulated over time. Leveraging recent advancements in the field, our sequential test (formalized as an e-process) quickly identifies when tracking failures set in whilst provably containing false alerts at a desired rate, and thus limiting potentially costly re-calibration or intervention steps. The approach is computationally light-weight, requires no extra training or fine-tuning, and is in principle model-agnostic. We propose both supervised and unsupervised variants by leveraging either ground-truth or solely internal tracking information, and demonstrate its effectiveness for two established tracking models across four video benchmarks. As such, sequential testing can offer a statistically grounded and efficient mechanism to incorporate safety assurances into real-time tracking systems."}

This paper proposes a method for evaluating the robustness of object detection ML models in autonomous vehicles under adverse weather conditions. It employs data augmentation operators to generate synthetic data that simulates different severance degrees of the adverse operation conditions at progressive intensity levels to find the lowest intensity of the adverse conditions at which the object detection model fails. The robustness of the object detection model is measured by the average first failure coefficients (AFFC) over the input images in the benchmark. The paper reports an experiment with four object detection models: YOLOv5s, YOLOv11s, Faster R-CNN, and Detectron2, utilising seven data augmentation operators that simulate weather conditions fog, rain, and snow, and lighting conditions of dark, bright, flaring, and shadow. The experiment data show that the method is feasible, effective, and efficient to evaluate and compare the robustness of object detection models in various adverse operation conditions. In particular, the Faster R-CNN model achieved the highest robustness with an overall average AFFC of 71.9% over all seven adverse conditions, while YOLO variants showed the AFFC values of 43%. The method is also applied to assess the impact of model training that targets adverse operation conditions using synthetic data on model robustness. It is observed that such training can improve robustness in adverse conditions but may suffer from diminishing returns and forgetting phenomena (i.e., decline in robustness) if overtrained."}

To bridge this gap, we introduce VimRAG, a framework tailored for multimodal Retrieval-augmented Reasoning across text, images, and videos. Inspired by our systematic study, we model the reasoning process as a dynamic directed acyclic graph that structures the agent states and retrieved multimodal evidence. Building upon this structured memory, we introduce a Graph-Modulated Visual Memory Encoding mechanism, with which the significance of memory nodes is evaluated via their topological position, allowing the model to dynamically allocate high-resolution tokens to pivotal evidence while compressing or discarding trivial clues. To implement this paradigm, we propose a Graph-Guided Policy Optimization strategy. This strategy disentangles step-wise validity from trajectory-level rewards by pruning memory nodes associated with redundant actions, thereby facilitating fine-grained credit assignment.

This study examines the trustworthiness of AI models, specifically the presence of bias, in detecting healthy multilingual English speakers among the cognitively impaired cohort, to make these tools clinically beneficial. For experiments, monolingual participants were recruited nationally (UK), and multilingual speakers were enrolled from four community centres in Sheffield and Bradford. In addition to a non-native English accent, multilinguals spoke Somali, Chinese, or South Asian languages, who were further divided into two Yorkshire accents (West and South) to challenge the efficiency of the AI tools thoroughly. Although ASR systems showed no significant bias across groups, classification and regression models using acoustic and linguistic features exhibited bias against multilingual speakers, particularly in memory, fluency, and reading tasks. This bias was more pronounced when models were trained on the publicly available DementiaBank dataset. Moreover, multilinguals were more likely to be misclassified as having cognitive decline. This study is the first of its kind to discover that, despite their strong overall performance, current AI models show bias against multilingual individuals from ethnic minority backgrounds in the UK, and they are also more likely to misclassify speakers with a certain accent (South Yorkshire) as living with a more severe cognitive decline. In this pilot study, we conclude that the existing AI tools are therefore not yet reliable for diagnostic use in these populations, and we aim to address this in future work by developing more generalisable, bias-mitigated models."}

In this paper, we reveal and study a highly-practical yet under-explored problem in TWI, termed Noisy Thinking (NT).

Such metrics frequently reward visually plausible outputs while overlooking controllability, edit localization, and faithfulness to user instructions. In this work, we introduce a fine-grained Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-as-a-Judge framework for image editing that decomposes common evaluation notions into twelve fine-grained interpretable factors spanning image preservation, edit quality, and instruction fidelity. Building on this formulation, we present a new human-validated benchmark that integrates human judgments, MLLM-based evaluations, model outputs, and traditional metrics across diverse image editing tasks. Through extensive human studies, we show that the proposed MLLM judges align closely with human evaluations at a fine granularity, supporting their use as reliable and scalable evaluators. We further demonstrate that traditional image editing metrics are often poor proxies for these factors, failing to distinguish over-edited or semantically imprecise outputs, whereas our judges provide more intuitive and informative assessments in both offline and online settings. Together, this work introduces a benchmark, a principled factorization, and empirical evidence positioning fine-grained MLLM judges as a practical foundation for studying, comparing, and improving image editing approaches."}

To address this gap in text-to-image generation, we recently proposed Curriculum-DPO, a method that organizes image pairs by difficulty. In this paper, we introduce Curriculum-DPO++, an enhanced method that combines the original data-level curriculum with a novel model-level curriculum. More precisely, we propose to dynamically increase the learning capacity of the denoising network as training advances. We implement this capacity increase via two mechanisms. First, we initialize the model with only a subset of the trainable layers used in the original Curriculum-DPO. As training progresses, we sequentially unfreeze layers until the configuration matches the full baseline architecture. Second, as the fine-tuning is based on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we implement a progressive schedule for the dimension of the low-rank matrices. Instead of maintaining a fixed capacity, we initialize the low-rank matrices with a dimension significantly smaller than that of the baseline. As training proceeds, we incrementally increase their rank, allowing the capacity to grow until it converges to the same rank value as in Curriculum-DPO. Furthermore, we propose an alternative ranking strategy to the one employed by Curriculum-DPO.

Recognizing the current scarcity of dedicated datasets in this domain, we introduce EPRBench, a high-quality benchmark specifically designed for event stream-based VPR. EPRBench comprises 10K event sequences and 65K event frames, collected using both handheld and vehicle-mounted setups to comprehensively capture real-world challenges across diverse viewpoints, weather conditions, and lighting scenarios. To support semantic-aware and language-integrated VPR research, we provide LLM-generated scene descriptions, subsequently refined through human annotation, establishing a solid foundation for integrating LLMs into event-based perception pipelines. To facilitate systematic evaluation, we implement and benchmark 15 state-of-the-art VPR algorithms on EPRBench, offering a strong baseline for future algorithmic comparisons. Furthermore, we propose a novel multi-modal fusion paradigm for VPR: leveraging LLMs to generate textual scene descriptions from raw event streams, which then guide spatially attentive token selection, cross-modal feature fusion, and multi-scale representation learning. This framework not only achieves highly accurate place recognition but also produces interpretable reasoning processes alongside its predictions, significantly enhancing model transparency and explainability.

Through trajectory analysis, we identify five failure modes (Self-Doubt, Social Conformity, Suggestion Hijacking, Emotional Susceptibility, and Reasoning Fatigue) with the first two accounting for 50% of failures.

Despite their practicality, LLM judges remain prone to miscalibration and systematic biases. This paper proposes SCOPE (Selective Conformal Optimized Pairwise Evaluation), a framework for selective pairwise judging with finite-sample statistical guarantees. Under exchangeability, SCOPE calibrates an acceptance threshold such that the error rate among non-abstained judgments is at most a user-specified level $α$. To provide SCOPE with a bias-neutral uncertainty signal, we introduce Bidirectional Preference Entropy (BPE), which queries the judge under both response positions, aggregates the implied preference probabilities to enforce invariance to response order, and converts the aggregated probability into an entropy-based uncertainty score. Across MT-Bench, RewardBench, and Chatbot Arena, BPE improves uncertainty quality over standard confidence proxies, providing a stronger selection signal that enables SCOPE to consistently meet the target risk level while retaining good coverage across judge scales. In particular, at $α= 0.10$, \\textsc{Scope} consistently satisfies the risk bound across all benchmarks and judge scales (empirical risk $\\approx 0.097$ to $0.099$), while retaining substantial coverage, reaching $0.89$ on RewardBench with Qwen-14B and $0.98$ on RewardBench with Qwen-32B.

To address this challenge, the Intrapartum Ultrasound Grand Challenge (IUGC), co-hosted with MICCAI 2024, was launched. The IUGC introduces a clinically oriented multi-task automatic measurement framework that integrates standard plane classification, fetal head-pubic symphysis segmentation, and biometry, enabling algorithms to exploit complementary task information for more accurate estimation. Furthermore, the challenge releases the largest multi-center intrapartum ultrasound video dataset to date, comprising 774 videos (68,106 frames) collected from three hospitals, providing a robust foundation for model training and evaluation. In this study, we present a comprehensive overview of the challenge design, review the submissions from eight participating teams, and analyze their methods from five perspectives: preprocessing, data augmentation, learning strategy, model architecture, and post-processing. In addition, we perform a systematic analysis of the benchmark results to identify key bottlenecks, explore potential solutions, and highlight open challenges for future research. Although encouraging performance has been achieved, our findings indicate that the field remains at an early stage, and further in-depth investigation is required before large-scale clinical deployment.

We propose a fully differentiable, deep-learning-based deformable registration framework that aligns individual pathological brains to a common atlas while preserving metastatic tissue without requiring lesion masks or preprocessing.\n  Missing anatomical correspondences caused by metastases are handled through a forward-model similarity metric based on distance-transformed anatomical labels, combined with a volume-preserving regularization term to ensure deformation plausibility. Registration performance was evaluated using Dice coefficient (DSC), Hausdorff distance (HD), average symmetric surface distance (ASSD), and Jacobian-based measures. The method was applied to 209 MBM patients from three centres, enabling standardized mapping of metastases to anatomical, arterial, and perfusion atlases.\n  The framework achieved high registration accuracy across datasets (DSC 0.89-0.92, HD 6.79-7.60 mm, ASSD 0.63-0.77 mm) while preserving metastatic volumes. Spatial analysis demonstrated significant over-representation of MBM in the cerebral cortex and putamen, under-representation in white matter, and consistent localization near the gray-white matter junction. No arterial territory showed increased metastasis frequency after volume correction.\n  This approach enables robust atlas registration of pathological brain MRI without lesion masks and supports reproducible multi-centre analyses. Applied to MBM, it confirms and refines known spatial predilections, particularly preferential seeding near the gray-white matter junction and cortical regions. The publicly available implementation facilitates reproducible research and extension to other brain tumours and neurological pathologies."}

This entropy rate implies that English contains nearly 80 percent redundancy relative to the five bits per character expected for random text. We introduce a statistical model that attempts to capture the intricate multi-scale structure of natural language, providing a first-principles account of this redundancy level. Our model describes a procedure of self-similarly segmenting text into semantically coherent chunks down to the single-word level. The semantic structure of the text can then be hierarchically decomposed, allowing for analytical treatment. Numerical experiments with modern LLMs and open datasets suggest that our model quantitatively captures the structure of real texts at different levels of the semantic hierarchy. The entropy rate predicted by our model agrees with the estimated entropy rate of printed English. Moreover, our theory further reveals that the entropy rate of natural language is not fixed but should increase systematically with the semantic complexity of corpora, which are captured by the only free parameter in our model."}

While Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer strong unification potential, existing approaches fail to adapt them into a single end-to-end backbone and lack effective knowledge distillation strategies for edge deployment. To address these limitations, we propose MLLMEmbed-ReID, a unified framework based on a powerful cloud-edge architecture. First, we adapt a foundational MLLM into a state-of-the-art cloud model. We leverage instruction-based prompting to guide the MLLM in generating a unified embedding space across RGB, infrared, sketch, and text modalities. This model is then trained efficiently with a hierarchical Low-Rank Adaptation finetuning (LoRA-SFT) strategy, optimized under a holistic cross-modal alignment objective. Second, to deploy its knowledge onto an edge-native student, we introduce a novel distillation strategy motivated by the low-rank property in the teacher's feature space. To prioritize essential information, this method employs a Principal Component Mapping loss, while relational structures are preserved via a Feature Relation loss. Our lightweight edge-based model achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple visual CM-ReID benchmarks, while its cloud-based counterpart excels across all CM-ReID benchmarks. The MLLMEmbed-ReID framework thus presents a complete and effective solution for deploying unified MLLM-level intelligence on resource-constrained devices.

Benefiting from strong semantic modeling and robust generalization, VLM-based end-to-end approaches have emerged as the mainstream paradigm in recent years. However, these models often suffer from substantial inference latency, as they must auto-regressively generate long token sequences when processing long-form documents. In this work, motivated by the extremely long outputs and complex layout structures commonly found in document parsing, we propose a training-free and highly efficient acceleration method. Inspired by speculative decoding, we employ a lightweight document parsing pipeline as a draft model to predict batches of future tokens, while the more accurate VLM verifies these draft predictions in parallel. Moreover, we further exploit the layout-structured nature of documents by partitioning each page into independent regions, enabling parallel decoding of each region using the same draft-verify strategy. The final predictions are then assembled according to the natural reading order. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach: on the general-purpose OmniDocBench, our method provides a 2.42x lossless acceleration for the dots.ocr model, and achieves up to 4.89x acceleration on long-document parsing tasks.

Deployed tracking systems usually lack formal safety assurances to convey when tracking is reliable and when it may fail, at best relying on heuristic measures of model confidence to raise alerts. To obtain such assurances we propose interpreting object tracking as a sequential hypothesis test, wherein evidence for or against tracking failures is gradually accumulated over time. Leveraging recent advancements in the field, our sequential test (formalized as an e-process) quickly identifies when tracking failures set in whilst provably containing false alerts at a desired rate, and thus limiting potentially costly re-calibration or intervention steps. The approach is computationally light-weight, requires no extra training or fine-tuning, and is in principle model-agnostic. We propose both supervised and unsupervised variants by leveraging either ground-truth or solely internal tracking information, and demonstrate its effectiveness for two established tracking models across four video benchmarks. As such, sequential testing can offer a statistically grounded and efficient mechanism to incorporate safety assurances into real-time tracking systems."}

In this paper, we theoretically analyze modality competition and propose a method for multimodal classification by maximizing the total correlation between multimodal features and labels. By maximizing this objective, our approach alleviates modality competition while capturing inter-modal interactions via feature alignment.

However, existing methods often struggle to reconcile global semantic structure with fine-grained boundary accuracy. This paper introduces DynaGuide, an adaptive segmentation framework that addresses these challenges through a novel dual-guidance strategy and dynamic loss optimization. Building on our previous work, DynaSeg, DynaGuide combines global pseudo-labels from zero-shot models such as DiffSeg or SegFormer with local boundary refinement using a lightweight CNN trained from scratch. This synergy allows the model to correct coarse or noisy global predictions and produce high-precision segmentations. At the heart of DynaGuide is a multi-component loss that dynamically balances feature similarity, Huber-smoothed spatial continuity, including diagonal relationships, and semantic alignment with the global pseudo-labels. Unlike prior approaches, DynaGuide trains entirely without ground-truth labels in the target domain and supports plug-and-play integration of diverse guidance sources. Extensive experiments on BSD500, PASCAL VOC2012, and COCO demonstrate that DynaGuide achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving mIoU by 17.5% on BSD500, 3.1% on PASCAL VOC2012, and 11.66% on COCO.

Such metrics frequently reward visually plausible outputs while overlooking controllability, edit localization, and faithfulness to user instructions. In this work, we introduce a fine-grained Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-as-a-Judge framework for image editing that decomposes common evaluation notions into twelve fine-grained interpretable factors spanning image preservation, edit quality, and instruction fidelity. Building on this formulation, we present a new human-validated benchmark that integrates human judgments, MLLM-based evaluations, model outputs, and traditional metrics across diverse image editing tasks. Through extensive human studies, we show that the proposed MLLM judges align closely with human evaluations at a fine granularity, supporting their use as reliable and scalable evaluators. We further demonstrate that traditional image editing metrics are often poor proxies for these factors, failing to distinguish over-edited or semantically imprecise outputs, whereas our judges provide more intuitive and informative assessments in both offline and online settings. Together, this work introduces a benchmark, a principled factorization, and empirical evidence positioning fine-grained MLLM judges as a practical foundation for studying, comparing, and improving image editing approaches."}

Existing dietary assessment methods largely rely on single-image analysis or appearance-based inference, including recent vision-language models, which lack explicit geometric reasoning and are sensitive to scale ambiguity. This benchmark reframes food portion estimation as an implicit-scale 3D reconstruction problem under monocular observations. To reflect real-world conditions, explicit physical references and metric annotations are removed; instead, contextual objects such as plates and utensils are provided, requiring algorithms to infer scale from implicit cues and prior knowledge. The dataset emphasizes multi-food scenes with diverse object geometries, frequent occlusions, and complex spatial arrangements. The benchmark was adopted as a challenge at the MetaFood 2025 Workshop, where multiple teams proposed reconstruction-based solutions. Experimental results show that while strong vision--language baselines achieve competitive performance, geometry-based reconstruction methods provide both improved accuracy and greater robustness, with the top-performing approach achieving 0.21 MAPE in volume estimation and 5.7 L1 Chamfer Distance in geometric accuracy."}

However, neither RLHF nor DPO take into account the fact that learning certain preferences is more difficult than learning other preferences, rendering the optimization process suboptimal. To address this gap in text-to-image generation, we recently proposed Curriculum-DPO, a method that organizes image pairs by difficulty. In this paper, we introduce Curriculum-DPO++, an enhanced method that combines the original data-level curriculum with a novel model-level curriculum. More precisely, we propose to dynamically increase the learning capacity of the denoising network as training advances. We implement this capacity increase via two mechanisms. First, we initialize the model with only a subset of the trainable layers used in the original Curriculum-DPO. As training progresses, we sequentially unfreeze layers until the configuration matches the full baseline architecture. Second, as the fine-tuning is based on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we implement a progressive schedule for the dimension of the low-rank matrices. Instead of maintaining a fixed capacity, we initialize the low-rank matrices with a dimension significantly smaller than that of the baseline. As training proceeds, we incrementally increase their rank, allowing the capacity to grow until it converges to the same rank value as in Curriculum-DPO. Furthermore, we propose an alternative ranking strategy to the one employed by Curriculum-DPO. Finally, we compare Curriculum-DPO++ against Curriculum-DPO and other state-of-the-art preference optimization approaches on nine benchmarks, outperforming the competing methods in terms of text alignment, aesthetics and human preference.

Across three MRI datasets with controlled duplication percentages and typical image augmentations, our metric robustly detects duplication and provides more consistent metric values across datasets.

The proposed SIEFormer is composed of two main branches, each corresponding to an implicit and explicit spectral perspective of the ViT, enabling joint optimization. The implicit branch realizes the use of different types of graph Laplacians to model the local structure correlations of tokens, along with a novel Band-adaptive Filter (BaF) layer that can flexibly perform both band-pass and band-reject filtering. The explicit branch, on the other hand, introduces a Maneuverable Filtering Layer (MFL) that learns global dependencies among tokens by applying the Fourier transform to the input ``value\" features, modulating the transformed signal with a set of learnable parameters in the frequency domain, and then performing an inverse Fourier transform to obtain the enhanced features. Extensive experiments reveal state-of-the-art performance on multiple image recognition datasets, reaffirming the superiority of our approach through ablation studies and visualizations."}

Anomaly detection is typically formulated as a one-class classification problem, where the training data consists solely of nominal values, leaving methods built on this assumption susceptible to training label noise. We present a dataset folding method that transforms an arbitrary one-class classifier-based anomaly detector into a fully unsupervised method. This is achieved by making a set of key weak assumptions: that anomalies are uncommon in the training dataset and generally heterogeneous. These assumptions enable us to utilize multiple independently trained instances of a one-class classifier to filter the training dataset for anomalies. This transformation requires no modifications to the underlying anomaly detector; the only changes are algorithmically selected data subsets used for training. We demonstrate that our method can transform a wide variety of one-class classifier anomaly detectors for both images and videos into unsupervised ones. Our method creates the first unsupervised logical anomaly detectors by transforming existing methods. We also demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance for unsupervised anomaly detection on the MVTec AD, ViSA, and MVTec Loco AD datasets. As improvements to one-class classifiers are made, our method directly transfers those improvements to the unsupervised domain, linking the domains."}

However, there are limited studies to further verify privacy risks by reconstructing realistic high-resolution face images from embeddings of these systems, especially for PPFR. In this work, we propose the face embedding mapping (FEM), a general framework that explores Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) for conducting the embedding-to-face attack by leveraging pre-trained Identity-Preserving diffusion model against state-of-the-art (SOTA) FR and PPFR systems. Based on extensive experiments, we verify that reconstructed faces can be used for accessing other real-word FR systems. Besides, the proposed method shows the robustness in reconstructing faces from the partial and protected face embeddings. Moreover, FEM can be utilized as a tool for evaluating safety of FR and PPFR systems in terms of privacy leakage. All images used in this work are from public datasets."}

Existing autoregressive models often fail when processing long sequences. They typically anchor poses to the first frame, which leads to attention decay, scale drift, and extrapolation errors. We introduce LongStream, a novel gauge-decoupled streaming visual geometry model for metric-scale scene reconstruction across thousands of frames. Our approach is threefold. First, we discard the first-frame anchor and predict keyframe-relative poses. This reformulates long-range extrapolation into a constant-difficulty local task. Second, we introduce orthogonal scale learning. This method fully disentangles geometry from scale estimation to suppress drift. Finally, we solve Transformer cache issues such as attention-sink reliance and long-term KV-cache contamination. We propose cache-consistent training combined with periodic cache refresh. This approach suppresses attention degradation over ultra-long sequences and reduces the gap between training and inference. Experiments show LongStream achieves state-of-the-art performance. It delivers stable, metric-scale reconstruction over kilometer-scale sequences at 18 FPS. Project Page: https://3dagentworld.github.io/longstream/"}

Objective assessment and validation of these techniques for specific clinically oriented tasks are crucial for their adoption in clinical motion analysis. AI-driven monocular MMC reduces the barriers to adoption in the clinic and has the potential to reduce the overhead for analysis of this common clinical assessment. Nine adult participants with no impairments performed the standardized UERW task, which entails reaching targets distributed across a virtual sphere centered on the torso, with targets displayed in a VR headset. Movements were simultaneously captured using a marker-based motion capture system and a set of eight FLIR cameras. We performed monocular video analysis on two of these video camera views to compare a frontal and offset camera configurations. The frontal camera orientation demonstrated strong agreement with the marker-based reference, exhibiting a minimal mean bias of $0.61 \\pm 0.12$ \\% reachspace reached per octanct (mean $\\pm$ standard deviation). In contrast, the offset camera view underestimated the percent workspace reached ($-5.66 \\pm 0.45$ \\% reachspace reached). Conclusion: The findings support the feasibility of a frontal monocular camera configuration for UERW assessment, particularly for anterior workspace evaluation where agreement with marker-based motion capture was highest. The overall performance demonstrates clinical potential for practical, single-camera assessments. This study provides the first validation of monocular MMC system for the assessment of the UERW task. By reducing technical complexity, this approach enables broader implementation of quantitative upper extremity mobility assessment."}

We propose FlexAM, a unified framework built upon a novel 3D control signal. This signal represents video dynamics as a point cloud, introducing three key enhancements: multi-frequency positional encoding to distinguish fine-grained motion, depth-aware positional encoding, and a flexible control signal for balancing precision and generative quality. This representation allows FlexAM to effectively disentangle appearance and motion, enabling a wide range of tasks including I2V/V2V editing, camera control, and spatial object editing.

To fit to the maximum context window constraint, current methods use keyframe sampling which can miss both macro-level events and micro-level details due to the sparse temporal coverage. Furthermore, processing full images and their tokens for each frame incurs substantial computational overhead. To address these limitations, we propose to leverage video codec primitives (specifically motion vectors and residuals) which natively encode video redundancy and sparsity without requiring expensive full-image encoding for most frames. To this end, we introduce lightweight transformer-based encoders that aggregate codec primitives and align their representations with image encoder embeddings through a pre-training strategy that accelerates convergence during end-to-end fine-tuning. Our approach reduces the time-to-first-token by up to $86\\%$ and token usage by up to $93\\%$ compared to standard VideoLMs. Moreover, by varying the keyframe and codec primitive densities we are able to maintain or exceed performance on $14$ diverse video understanding benchmarks spanning general question answering, temporal reasoning, long-form understanding, and spatial scene understanding."}
